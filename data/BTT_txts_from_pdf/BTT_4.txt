PART A
DRIVING LICENCES

INTRODUCTION
The “Basic Theory of Driving” handbook is essential reading for all road users in Singapore, which comprise the pedestrians, cyclists,
motorcyclists and drivers. It covers The Highway Code, which includes the traffic rules, traffic regulations, traffic signs and signals,
and it aims to educate and promote road safety for the road users. Many of the rules and regulations in the Code are legal requirements,
and if you disobey them, you are committing a traffic offence. You may be fined and given demerit points on your driving licence,
which may lead to suspension or revocation of your driving licence, or you may be disqualified by the Courts from driving. Knowing
and applying the traffic rules and regulations in The Highway Code could significantly help to reduce road accidents, casualties and
fatalities on our roads.

WHAT IS A DRIVING LICENCE?

A driving licence is a legal document issued by the Traffic Police under the Road Traffic Act, which identifies the licensee, sets
out the class(es) of vehicle(s) which he/she may legally drive and states such restrictions or conditions as may apply as well as
the period for which the licence is valid, where applicable.
