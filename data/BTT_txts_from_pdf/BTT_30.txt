EXPRESSWAY MONITORING AND ADVISORY SYSTEM (EMAS)
44 Motorists should look out for these three types of electronic signboards when travelling towards and along the expressways; and
selected major arterial roads.

(a) TRAVEL TIME DISPLAY (TTD)
These electronic advisory signboards are placed at various entrances leading to the expressways. They provide estimated
travel times to selected exits on the expressways from the point the motorist enters a particular expressway. For example, if
a motorist enters CTE, he/she will notice the TTD as below. The estimated travel time to the expressway exit of Ang Mo Kio
Avenue 1 is about 5 minutes from the point he/she enters CTE.
The estimated travel times are displayed in colour. Green indicates the travel time displayed is up to 50% more than normal
travel time, yellow indicates the travel time displayed is between 50% to 125% more than normal travel time and red indicates
the travel time displayed is more than 125% of normal travel time.
Messages are also displayed on this signboard pertaining to incidents on the expressway. For example, the message
“ACCIDENT on CTE (SLE)” displayed on the TTD below informs motorists that there is an accident occurring on the CTE
in the direction towards SLE.

In the TTD below, the travel times are displayed in a single colour. The text “ACCIDENT” toggles with “ON CTE (AYE)”
to inform motorists that there is accident occurrence on CTE in the direction of AYE. TTDs like these will be phased out.
