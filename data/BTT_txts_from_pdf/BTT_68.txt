PART B
CODE OF CONDUCT ON THE ROAD

Safe Driving Technique (Defensive Driving Technique)

189 When the headlight of an oncoming vehicle dazzles you, look to your left to
avoid the glare. Use the edge of the road to guide your vehicle. If the light is
blinding, slow down and stop by the side of the road.

190 When facing oncoming traffic, dip your headlights.

191 Dip your headlight when you are immediately behind another vehicle. If not, the beam from your headlight will be reflected by
the rear view mirror of the car in front and dazzle the driver.

192 On approaching bends where visibility is poor, use your high beam. This will attract the attention of other road users and warn
them of your approach.

193 It is safer not to out-drive your normal headlight range. The average headlight on high beam is about 100 metres.
