ELECTRIC MOTORCYCLE (EM)
INTRODUCTION
230 Electric powered motorcycles and scooters are plug-in-electric vehicles with two or three wheels. The electricity is stored on
board in a rechargeable battery, which drives one or more electric motors.
231 Electric powered motorcycles and scooters are generally of the same size and weight and are comparable in performance with
petrol driven motorcycles.

FEATURES OF ELECTRIC MOTORCYCLES
232 The features of the electric motorcycles are similar to the petrol engine motorcycles. They generally have the same operating
function such as brakes, mirrors, lights and etc.
233 The only difference is that electric motorcycle runs on automatic transmission gear without having the clutch which is used for
manual transmission motorcycles. Similarly, some petrol engine motorcycles and scooters presently runs on automatic
transmission.
234 Electric motorcycles have better acceleration as they develop higher torque. Generally electric motorcycles weigh lighter and
have a low engine noise.

ADAPTING TO ELECTRIC MOTORCYCLE
236 Although the electric motorcycle features and operations are quite similar to petrol engine motorcycles, riders should accustom
