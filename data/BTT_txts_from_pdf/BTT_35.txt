FACILITY SIGNS
46 Facility signs give motorists information of facilities and the
direction to take to get to them. These signs have black
letters on white backgrounds with black borders.

47 Directions leading to places of interest for tourists have
white multi-lingual text on a brown background with white
borders, white arrows and pictures.

VEHICLE MARKINGS
48 Vehicles carrying dangerous goods are required to display
hazard information signs,
e.g. DANGER- HIGHLY FLAMMABLE.

49 Long vehicles are required to display at least 3 yellow
reflective markings on each side of the vehicle and at least
1 red reflective marking at the rear of the vehicle. This is to
make them more conspicuous to other road users, especially
at night.
Long vehicles comprise:
(a) Goods vehicles with length exceeding 10 metres;
(b) Trailers with length exceeding 5 metres; and
(c) Mobile cranes with length exceeding 10 metres
(Note: Mobile cranes require fitting of rear markings only).

50 Vehicle speed limit
Buses, goods vehicles and trailers are required to display a
marking showing the maximum speed in kilometres per
hour at which the vehicle may be driven or, in the case of a
trailer, drawn on a road. Such vehicles must not travel faster
than their vehicle speed limit or the posted road speed limit,
whichever is lower.
