Multiple Notice Of Demerit Points Accumulated
23 Motorists will be notified and updated of their demerit point status after settling every offence where demerit points are awarded.
The intent of the letter is to pre-warn the licence holders to improve their driving behaviour, and encourage them to remain
offence-free for 12 months for their demerit points to be expunged; otherwise they may face the consequence of becoming liable
for suspension.
Incentives For Good Driving Behaviour
24 A licence holder who maintains a 12-month period free of scheduled offences from the date of the last scheduled offence
committed will have all his/her previous demerit points removed from his/her record.
25 A licence holder who maintains a 24-month period free of scheduled offences from the date of expiry of the last suspension will
also have all his/her previous suspension(s) removed from his/her record, i.e. he/she will be treated similar to a driver with no
previous suspension record.
26 Motorists with a clean driving record for a continuous period of three years will enjoy a discount over and above the usual NoClaim Bonus when they renew their insurance policy with participating insurance companies. They must also not have made any
claims on their vehicles’ insurance for the past three years.
27 The public can check on a driver’s driving licence status and demerit points accumulated via Singapore Police Force e-Services
at www.police.gov.sg/e-services.
