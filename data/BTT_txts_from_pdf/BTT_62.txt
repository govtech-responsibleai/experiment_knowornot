PART B
CODE OF CONDUCT ON THE ROAD

The ‘Two-Second’ Rule / Stopping Distance

THE ‘TWO-SECOND’ RULE
135 A simple way to ensure a safe gap between you and the vehicle in front is to use the ‘two-second’ rule. As the vehicle in front of
you passes a stationary object, such as a lamp post on the side of the road, start counting to yourself ‘one-thousand-and-one, one
thousand-and-two’. This will take you 2 seconds. If you reach the same spot before you finish these eight words, you are following
too closely and it is necessary to slow down. This rule will keep you at a safe following distance and will apply to all types of
vehicles at any speed.

(Vehicle ‘A’ does not pass the lamp post before counting “one-thousand-and-one, one-thousand-and-two”. Thus vehicle
‘A’ is at a safe following distance from vehicle ‘B’)
136 Always watch for the brake lights of the car immediately in front and the traffic ahead of the car in front.

STOPPING DISTANCE
137 It takes a longer distance to stop a moving vehicle than most people think. It is therefore prudent to study the chart below and
remember that your stopping distance is approximately the sum of your reaction distance and braking distance. These distances
will increase with the driving speeds of your vehicle.

138 The braking distance will also increase when the road is wet, or if the tyre treads are worn, or when the car is fully loaded. Reaction
time will also increase if a driver is tired or if he/she has consumed alcohol.
