ROAD USERS AT WORK ZONES
Motorists, Motorcyclists or Cyclists
205 Take special care to watch out for the warning of the work activity and the obstruction ahead. Be alert of the traffic situation
around you.
206 Observe the orange warning and information signs that are to help you. You must not exceed any temporary maximum speed
limit posted at the work zone for your safety.
207 Get into the correct lane in good time. Do not switch lanes to overtake queuing traffic or move through an area marked off by
traffic cones or barriers.
208 Be careful not to get into the path of traffic entering or leaving the work area. Do not be distracted by the activity in the work
area. Concentrate on the road ahead and keep a safe distance from the traffic in front.
Pedestrians
209 Keep away from the work area. Do not enter the work area for convenience or a short cut.
210 Follow the direction sign for the alternative path provided when the footpath is blocked.
Do not walk along the traffic lane if it is not designated and cordoned off for pedestrians.

WORK ZONE SIGNS
211 These signs are displayed along the work zone, the section of the road affected by a work activity where temporary traffic control
is exercised. These signs contain a black symbol or message with or without a logo on an orange background and are either
diamond-shaped for warning or rectangular-shaped for information to the road users. Lateral shift markers are work zone signs
that indicate a lateral change in direction of the carriageway or a sharp bend in a road diversion through the work zone.
