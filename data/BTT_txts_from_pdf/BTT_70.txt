199 TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
Traffic conditions vary depending on time, place and situation. Traffic may be congested or relatively light. The speed of other
vehicles also varies. Try to drive with the traffic in order not to disrupt its flow.
200 Adjust your speed to the traffic and road situation. Situations change as you travel from urban built-up areas to sub-urban and
then to rural areas.

URBAN

SUB-URBAN

RURAL

201 In urban areas, traffic is slow and heavy. Traffic is faster and lighter in suburban areas. In rural areas, traffic is generally light.
Whatever the traffic conditions, the driver has the responsibility to be careful and alert at all times.
202 DRIVING OVERSEAS
Most countries in Europe adopt a left hand drive system, ie. you’ll find the steering wheel on the other side of the car.
For more information on overseas driving tips, please refer to the Automobile Association of Singapore’s website. Being prepared
will allow you to drive more confidently.
