PART B
CODE OF CONDUCT ON THE ROAD

Safe Driving Technique (Defensive Driving Technique)

180 On a rainy day, a thin layer of water forms on the road surface. Even good
tyres may not have a good grip on the road. As speed increases, surface water
builds up under the vehicle’s tyres. When this happens, your vehicle will
glide on the surface of the road, and this is known as ‘Aquaplaning’.
181 Aquaplaning results in the loss of steering control and braking efficiency.
The faster you go, the more difficult it will be to control the vehicle. To
counter this, you should slow down by braking intermittently (on/off
braking) until you gain control of your vehicle.

182 When approaching a road that is flooded but passable to vehicles, engage a
lower gear to go through the flood

183 After passing through water, the brakes become ineffective. To dry the
brakes, pump the brake pedal repeatedly until braking action returns.

184 You can also dry the brakes by gently depressing the brake pedal with your
left foot while pressing the accelerator with the right foot.

185 At night, the depth of flood water can be deceptive. If in doubt, take an alternative route.
186 Stretches of open highways are usually subjected to strong winds. To avoid the danger of being forced into the path of other traffic
by the wind, you should slow down and drive cautiously.
187 LIGHT CONDITIONS
Too much or too little light will affect our ability to see. Sun-glare or light reflected off objects or a pool of water on the road
can dazzle and even blind our vision. You should wear sunglasses or lower the sun-visor when it is very bright.

188 Switch on your headlights from 7pm to 7am. Drive at a slower speed than you would during the day.
