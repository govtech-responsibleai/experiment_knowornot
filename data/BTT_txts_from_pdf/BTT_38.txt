Common Road Markings

52 Common road markings ALONG the road.

(a) Broken White Line
A broken white line is the centre line of a two-way road. Vehicles
should keep to the left of this line.

(b) Continuous White Line
A continuous white line is the centre line of a two-way road.
Vehicles should keep to the left of this line. Parking is not
allowed on either side of the road at all times.
Motorists can only cross a single continuous or broken white
line when they can see that the road ahead is clear & it is safe
to do so.

(c) Unbroken Double White Lines
Parallel continuous white lines in the centre of a two-way road
indicate no parking on either side of the road at all times.
Vehicles are also not allowed to cross these lines.
Where continuous double white lines are painted on a road to
separate traffic flowing in opposite directions, you may not
overtake at the double white lines unless you keep entirely to
the left of such lines.
Never cross double white lines. Making a U-turn or a right turn
is not allowed on a road where such lines are painted.
