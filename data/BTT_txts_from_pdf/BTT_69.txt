CODE OF CONDUCT ON THE ROAD

Safe Driving Technique (Defensive Driving Technique)

194 ROAD CONDITIONS
A good driver should know how to read and adjust his/her speed accordingly to suit the road conditions, such as:
(a) The width of the road;
(b) The kind of road surface he/she is driving on;
(c) The contour of the road;
(d) The possible danger of hazards ahead.

195 On a sandy or pebbled surface, there is a greater risk of ‘side slipping’. Try
to avoid hard acceleration, braking and sudden sharp turning of the steering
wheel.

196 If the rear of your vehicle skids side way, remove the foot from the
accelerator at once. Never apply the brakes during a skid correction, steer in
the direction of the skid.

(a) On roads with uneven surfaces, drive slowly.

(b) If you encounter large pot-holes, reduce your
speed further and proceed slowly.

197 When driving round a bend or sharp corner at high speed, your vehicle tends to be pushed out of its path of travel by a force called
the Centrifugal Force.

198 The greater the travelling speed around the curve or the sharper the curve,
the more the vehicle will be pushed from its path. You should therefore
reduce speed when going round a bend. The diagram on the right shows the
appropriate speed and the dangerous speed for each turning radius.
