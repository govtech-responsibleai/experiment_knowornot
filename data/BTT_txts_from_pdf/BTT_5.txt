TEST OF COMPETENCE TO DRIVE

An applicant for a new class of licence must pass the test of competence to drive, which includes the theory and/or practical
driving/riding tests:
(a) Basic Theory Test (BTT)
The Basic Theory Test (BTT) is designed to test your knowledge of the traffic rules, traffic regulations, traffic signs and
signals as well as general road safety. The testing curriculum for BTT is broadly covered in the handbook titled “The Official
Handbook - Basic Theory of Driving” and all learner drivers and riders must obtain a pass for BTT before they can proceed
to take the advanced theory test i.e. the Final Theory Test (FTT) or the Riding Theory Test (RTT).
(b) Final Theory Test (FTT)
After passing the BTT, and if you want to obtain a motorcar driving licence (Class 3 or 3A), you must pass your FTT before
you can take the Practical Driving Test. The FTT aims to test your knowledge on driving safety aspects and proper techniques
of driving, as well as your interaction with other road users whilst driving on the roads. After you have passed your FTT, you
are required to pass the Practical Driving Test within two years, failing which, you will have to retake and pass your FTT
again before you can apply for another Practical Driving Test. The testing curriculum for FTT is broadly covered in the
handbook titled “The Official Handbook - Final Theory of Driving”.
(c) Riding Theory Test (RTT)
After passing the BTT, and if you want to obtain a motorcycle driving licence (Class 2B), you must pass your RTT before
you can take the Practical Riding Test. The RTT aims to test your knowledge on riding safety aspects and proper techniques
of riding, as well as your interaction with other road users whilst riding on the roads. After you have passed your RTT, you
are required to pass the Practical Riding Test within one year, failing which, you have to retake and pass your RTT again
before you can apply for another Practical Riding Test.
(d) Practical Driving / Riding Test
The Practical Driving / Riding Test will be conducted by a Driving Examiner appointed by the Traffic Police. You must
provide a motor vehicle which is suitable for the test, in good mechanical condition and properly insured against third-party
