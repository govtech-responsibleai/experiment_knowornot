PART C
EMERGENCY/INCIDENT PROCEDURES (TUNNELS)
251 Radio break-in is an important tool for the OCC to communicate with motorists in the tunnel during an emergency and as a good
driving habit, motorists are encouraged to tune into an FM radio channel before entering the tunnel.
Fire Protection
252 Portable fire extinguishers are also provided in the emergency cabinet which is available at
50m intervals along the tunnel. Motorists can make use of the fire extinguishers to put out
any small scale fire in their vehicles.
253 MCE and Woodsville tunnels are equipped with a water-based firefighting system. This is an
overhead water sprinkler system that helps suppress fire growth rates to further protect major
structural tunnel elements and minimise the potential impact of a fire.
254 Coupled with the ventilation system present in all our road tunnels, the water-based
firefighting system enhances the overall incident management process in the event of fire
