TRAFFIC RULES & REGULATIONS

Road-Hogging / Speed Limits /
The “Give Way Rule” At Road Junctions

ROAD-HOGGING
77 Road-Hogging is driving at an unreasonably slow speed on the road especially on the right-hand or along the centre of the road.
Road-Hogging hinders the flow of traffic behind and may cause other vehicles to pass dangerously on the left. Motorists who
travel at a slow speed should keep to the left side of the road; this applies especially to small capacity motorcycles, goods vehicles
and lorries. You should only use the right hand lane when overtaking or when you are about to turn right or make a U-turn.

SPEED LIMITS
78 Unless otherwise stated, the speed limit of all roads in Singapore is 50 km/h. Do not exceed the speed limit of your vehicle or the
road, whichever is the lesser.
79 Always obey the “Reduce Speed Now” sign.

THE ‘GIVE WAY’ RULE AT ROAD JUNCTIONS
80 When approaching a junction with a major road, slow down gradually and give way to traffic on the major road. Where there is
a “STOP” sign, stop before the stop-line.
81 At an uncontrolled junction where there are no traffic lights, “GIVE WAY” sign or “STOP” sign:
(a) If you are going straight across the junction, you must give way to traffic going straight from the right.

(b) If you are turning right, you must give way to traffic going straight from all directions, as well as traffic turning right from
the right and traffic turning left from the opposite direction.

(c) If you are turning left, you must give way to traffic going straight from the right.
