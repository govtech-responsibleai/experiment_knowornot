6.2 What is the deductible?
The deductible is the fixed amount that you need to pay before MediShield Life
starts to pay out. You only have to pay this once in any insurance policy year
you are hospitalised. The deductible ranges from $2,000 to $4,500 of the
claimable amount, depending on your age and choice of ward class as shown
in Table I.
