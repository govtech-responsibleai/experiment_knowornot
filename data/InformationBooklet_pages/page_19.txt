6. Making a claim under MediShield Life
To claim from MediShield Life, you just need to inform the hospital or medical
institution where you are receiving treatment and they will submit the claim on
your behalf.
Payment from MediShield Life will be made directly to the hospital or medical
institution once it has been processed.
The claimable amount under MediShield Life is determined by adjusting the bill
based on the pro-ration factor (explained in section 6.1) and applying the claim
limits in Table A.
For inpatient treatments and day surgeries, the MediShield Life payout is
computed by applying the deductible (explained in section 6.2) and co-insurance
(explained in section 6.3) to the claimable amount. The deductible and coinsurance, as well as the bill above the claim limits, can be paid using MediSave
and/or cash.
