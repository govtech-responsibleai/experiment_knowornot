The annual premiums can be fully paid using MediSave. You can pay your
premium from your MediSave, or your family members (i.e. spouse, parents,
children, grandchildren or siblings) may pay your premium using their MediSave.
Premiums (after any applicable subsidies) are automatically deducted from your
(or your payer’s) MediSave each year. If there is insufficient balance in the
MediSave Account to pay the premiums, you (or your payer) will be informed to
top up your (or your payer’s) MediSave or arrange a family member to help pay
the premiums. For more details, please visit cpf.gov.sg/MSLtopup.
