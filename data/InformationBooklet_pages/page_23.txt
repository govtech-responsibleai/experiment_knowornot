Illustration of how the deductible works
(The examples are based on assumptions that the members are below
80 years old and stay in Ward C.
The deductible is $2,000 per policy year. Payouts from MediShield Life are
subject to claim limits.)
Scenario A:
Mr. A is hospitalised once in each
policy year.
1st hospitalisation
Claimable Amount: $3,000
Deductible: $2,000

2nd hospitalisation
Claimable Amount: $2,500
Deductible: $2,000

As the claimable amount is above
the deductible, there is payout from
MediShield Life

As the claimable amount is above
the deductible, there is payout from
MediShield Life

Policy Year: 1 Apr 25 – 31 Mar 26

Policy Year: 1 Apr 2026 – 31 Mar 2027

2026

1st hospitalisation
Claimable Amount: $1,000
Deductible: $2,000
As the claimable amount is
less than the deductible of
$2,000, there is no payout
from MediShield Life.

1 April
2027

2nd hospitalisation
Claimable Amount: $2,000
Deductible Balance for Policy Year:
$1,000
As Mr B had paid the deductible of
$1,000 during the 1st hospitalisation, he
only needs to pay the balance
deductible of $1,000 for the 2nd
hospitalisation.

Scenario B:
Mr. B is hospitalised twice in the
same policy year.
