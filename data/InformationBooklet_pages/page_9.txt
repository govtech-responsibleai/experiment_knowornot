3.3 Who needs to pay Additional Premiums?
Under MediShield Life, those with pre-existing medical conditions can enjoy
coverage for their conditions. Only those with serious pre-existing medical
conditions need to pay an Additional Premium of 30% for the first 10 years, in
addition to the standard MediShield Life premiums.
A pre-existing condition is a medical condition or illness that an individual
already has before he is covered under an insurance plan. If the medical
condition developed after the start of an insurance cover, it is not considered a
pre-existing condition.
Examples of serious pre-existing conditions for which you may have to pay
Additional Premiums include cancer, kidney failure, stroke and heart diseases.
Refer to the MOH website for more information on the broad categories of
serious pre-existing conditions.
Those with serious pre-existing conditions will be informed to pay Additional
Premiums. Any applicable MediShield Life premium subsidies will also apply to
the Additional Premiums.
