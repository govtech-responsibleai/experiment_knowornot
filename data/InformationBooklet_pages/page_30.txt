8. Additional private insurance coverage
MediShield Life is designed to cover subsidised bills in public hospitals. Hence,
if you intend to seek non-subsidised treatments in public hospitals or private
hospitals, you may consider buying additional private insurance coverage in the
form of an Integrated Shield Plan (IP).

8.1 What is an Integrated Shield Plan?
An IP is made up of a MediShield Life component that is a national medical
insurance scheme by the Government and an additional private insurance
coverage component provided by a private insurer.
IP premiums are higher than MediShield Life premiums. Before you take up an
IP cover, do consider if you can afford your IP premiums in the long term,
especially since premiums increase with age.
Do speak with your financial planner or approach any of the participating
insurers for more information on IPs. Please visit the MOH website for the list
of participating insurers.
