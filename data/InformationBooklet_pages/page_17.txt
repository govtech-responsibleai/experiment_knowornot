4.5 Who is eligible for Additional Premium Support?
Additional Premium Support provides financial assistance to members who are
unable to afford their premiums after premium subsidies and MediSave use, and
have limited family support.
Members who are unable to afford their premiums will be invited to apply for
Additional Premium Support, and the Government will help them with the
process if they are unable to do so themselves. No one will lose MediShield Life
coverage due to financial difficulties.
