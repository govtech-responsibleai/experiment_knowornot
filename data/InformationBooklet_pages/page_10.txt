3.4 What are premium rebates?
Under MediShield Life, members pay premiums ahead during their working
ages, and in return enjoy premium rebates during their older ages. This helps
to distribute premiums more evenly throughout one’s life and moderate the
premium increases during the older ages when one becomes less
economically active.
The premium rebates you receive depend on how long you have been insured
under the scheme. The earlier you join the scheme, the higher the premium
rebates you will receive.
