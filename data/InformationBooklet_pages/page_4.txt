1. Introduction to MediShield Life
MediShield Life is an individual basic healthcare insurance scheme that protects
all Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents against large healthcare bills
for life, regardless of age or health condition.
The Government provides various premium subsidies and support measures to
ensure that MediShield Life premiums remain affordable. No one will lose
MediShield Life coverage due to an inability to pay insurance premiums.

2. Benefits under MediShield Life
MediShield Life covers expenses incurred for hospitalisations and selected
approved outpatient treatments, such as kidney dialysis, cancer drug treatment
and radiotherapy for cancer.
The benefits under MediShield Life are shown in Table A. They are designed to
cover subsidised bills incurred for hospitalisations in Ward B2/C and subsidised
outpatient/day surgery treatments in public hospitals. Patients who seek
treatments in unsubsidised wards or unsubsidised outpatient treatments in
public hospitals, as well as private hospital patients, will also be able to benefit
from MediShield Life. However, as unsubsidised and private bills are higher,
MediShield Life will cover a comparatively smaller portion of the bill.
