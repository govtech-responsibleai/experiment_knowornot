6.1 What is the pro-ration factor?
MediShield Life benefits are designed to cover subsidised bills incurred by
Singapore Citizens at public hospitals. Hence, non-subsidised bills, which are
typically larger than subsidised bills, are pro-rated before the claims under
MediShield Life are computed. This is to ensure that policyholders receive
comparable MediShield Life payouts, regardless of whether they opt for
subsidised or non-subsidised care. Similarly, Permanent Residents who receive
less subsidies than Singapore Citizens at public hospitals will also have their
bills pro-rated before claims under MediShield Life are computed. The
applicable pro-ration factors are shown in Tables G and H.
