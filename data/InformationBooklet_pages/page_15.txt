4.4 What does Premium Cap mean? What is the Phased Support and
who is eligible for it?
To cushion the MediShield Life premium increases, the total premium increase
over the next review cycle of 3 years is capped such that the highest increase
one would experience is 35% by the end of the third year, when compared to
premiums in 2024. Additionally, the premium increases will be phased in evenly
over these three years. This will be effected through the Phased Support which
is provided to all Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents for two years. It
is applied to the net premium increase between the new MediShield Life
premium and the premium before 1 April 2025 (after any applicable Premium
Subsidies, Pioneer Generation Subsidies, or Merdeka Generation Subsidies).
The Premium Cap and the Phased Support are automatically given to all
Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents regardless of household income
and Annual Value of their residences. These will be supported through the
MediShield Life Fund.
