3. Coverage and premium payment
Newborns who are Singapore Citizens are covered from birth under MediShield
Life following birth registration. Permanent Residents are covered from the day
they attain permanent residency.

3.1 What is a MediShield Life policy year?
A MediShield Life policy year refers to the 12-month period from the date the
cover starts or is renewed. For example, for a cover that starts on 1 November
2015, the policy year of the cover is from 1 November 2015 to 31 October 2016.
MediShield Life cover automatically renews on the anniversary of each policy
year. Using the same example, the cover will be renewed for another policy year
on 1 November 2016.

3.2 How much is the MediShield Life premium?
MediShield Life premiums increase with age. The premium is payable once a
year and is based on your Age Next Birthday on the policy start/renewal date.
For example, if the insured memberâ€™s date of birth is 10 October 1990 and his
policy is renewed on 1 November 2015, his Age Next Birthday on 1 November
2015 is 26 years old.
Any applicable subsidies are automatically applied to the premium before
premium payment.
Premiums (before subsidies) for the different age groups are shown in Table B.
