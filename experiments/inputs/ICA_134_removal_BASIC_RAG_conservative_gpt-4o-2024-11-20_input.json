Travellers can edit the members in a group by adding or removing the member profile and regenerating the QR code even in offline mode (i.e., without mobile data). Travellers have the option to customise group names (e.g., 'Family', or 'Friends') to better fit their travel requirements.\nQuestion 2: What will happen if a traveller or his/her travel companion submits wrong passport information while generating the QR code?\nAnswer 2: It is crucial for travellers to verify and confirm the accuracy of the details included in the QR code. Failure to do so may lead to inconvenience when they undergo immigration clearance at Singapore Land checkpoints.If you need to correct any inaccuracies in the information you have provided, you may edit the details through navigating to the 'edit' option under your profile.\nQuestion 3: Are travellers required to bring their passport along when travelling to Malaysia, given that they can now use a QR code for immigration clearance?\nAnswer 3: The QR code can only be used for immigration clearance at Singapore land checkpoints via car, motorcycle, lorry and bus.Travellers are reminded to bring their passports when travelling overseas, as it remains the official travel document for identification during overseas travel.\nQuestion 4: What should the traveller do when his/her QR code is expiring?\nAnswer 4: When the traveller accesses the QR code via the MyICA mobile app and their passports is still valid, the QR code's validity will be automatically extended. Hence, no further actions are required for these group of travellers.The QR code will be invalid for use once the passport has expired. MyICA mobile app will prompt users that their passport has expired or is expiring (i.e., passport with less than six months' validity).After travellers have received a new passport, they can update their or others' profile information in MyICA mobile app. This includes making changes to details such as the new passport number and passport expiry date.\n",

You may enrol in any full-time, non-religious course within the duration of your existing pass.If you hold a valid LTVP or DP and wish to study in an approved religious school/madrasah, you will still need to obtain a Student’s Pass. Holders of a valid IEO are exempted from this requirement.\nQuestion 1: Will a Student's Pass Holder be issued a Long-Term Pass automatically upon course completion?\nAnswer 1: Upon course completion, students will have to cancel their Student's Pass (STP) and surrender any physical STP card that was issued to them for cancellation to ICA. Upon cancellation of their STP, they may be granted a short-term visit pass to stay in Singapore (up to 89 days).If you are studying in an Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) and wish to have a longer period of stay to look for jobs upon completion of your course, you may apply for a one-year (non-renewable) long term visit pass (LTVP).You may refer to LTVP for Graduate from IHL Seeking Employment in Singapore for more details.\nQuestion 2: Can Long-Term Pass Holders still travel with a passport which is expiring in 6 months' time or less?\nAnswer 2: Generally, as long as long-term passes (i.e. Student's Pass, Long Term Visit Pass, Work Permit, Employment Pass and Dependant’s Pass, etc.) are valid, the pass holders are able to use their current valid passport upon seeking arrival and departure immigration clearance at the Singapore checkpoints.However, they are advised to be mindful of the immigration requirements of any country they wish to depart, visit or place of return when travelling on a passport that is less than six months valid before embarking on their journey. Where applicable, they should also check with the airline to ensure that they are allowed to board the plane as airlines have the prerogative to issue boarding passes to their passengers.As Singapore’s border measures and entry requirements will evolve as the global situation changes, please visit the MOH website and ICA website for the latest updates on travel and health control measures.It is important for a long-term pass holder to renew his/her foreign passport if it is expiring. Ensuring that a passport remains valid will allow ICA to determine his/her foreign citizenship.For all matters relating to foreign passport, please approach the respective Embassy/Consulate/Overseas Mission in Singapore.Once a new passport is obtained, a long-term pass holder will need to update his/her new passport details with the relevant issuing authority accordingly.ICA-issued Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders are required to update his/her new passport details with ICA accordingly once he/she has been issued with a new passport.\nQuestion 3: What is required for a LTVP holder to work in Singapore?\nAnswer 3: LTVP/LTVP+ holders may only commence work after they are issued a valid Letter of Consent (LOC) from Ministry of Manpower, along with a valid LTVP. You may continue to work if you have been issued with a valid work pass from Ministry of Manpower separately.\nQuestion 4: What is the difference between visa and visit pass?\nAnswer 4: A valid Singapore visa is not an immigration pass. A valid entry visa is a pre-entry requirement that you must apply for before travelling to seek entry into Singapore if you hold a travel document issued by one of the following countries/places listed on ICA website.Possessing a valid visa does not guarantee entry into Singapore. You will have to satisfy the basic entry requirements (https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart/entering-singapore) before being considered for entry into Singapore.The grant of a visit pass is determined by the ICA officers at the point of entry. The period of stay granted is shown on the visit pass endorsement given on the passport or the electronic Visit Pass (e-Pass) issued to you through email. You can visit the e-Pass portal or use the Visit Pass Validity Tool to check the expiry of your e-Pass or visit pass.

In this case, to ensure a seamless and smooth travel experience, the traveller should use a group QR code that contains his/her three other travelling companions' profiles if only four (and not five) people are travelling.Tip: Traveller can create a group QR code that has five profiles and another separate QR code that contains four profiles. Different QR codes can be named uniquely (e.g., Family, Friends, and Colleagues).\nQuestion 1: Can travellers update the members in the group QR code for different trips?\nAnswer 1: The MyICA mobile app can store multiple group QR codes with different group members. Travellers can edit the members in a group by adding or removing the member profile and regenerating the QR code even in offline mode (i.e., without mobile data). Travellers have the option to customise group names (e.g., 'Family', or 'Friends') to better fit their travel requirements.\nQuestion 2: What will happen if a traveller or his/her travel companion submits wrong passport information while generating the QR code?\nAnswer 2: It is crucial for travellers to verify and confirm the accuracy of the details included in the QR code. Failure to do so may lead to inconvenience when they undergo immigration clearance at Singapore Land checkpoints.If you need to correct any inaccuracies in the information you have provided, you may edit the details through navigating to the 'edit' option under your profile.\nQuestion 3: What should the traveller do when his/her QR code is expiring?\nAnswer 3: When the traveller accesses the QR code via the MyICA mobile app and their passports is still valid, the QR code's validity will be automatically extended. Hence, no further actions are required for these group of travellers.The QR code will be invalid for use once the passport has expired. MyICA mobile app will prompt users that their passport has expired or is expiring (i.e., passport with less than six months' validity).After travellers have received a new passport, they can update their or others' profile information in MyICA mobile app. This includes making changes to details such as the new passport number and passport expiry date.\nQuestion 4: What happens if travellers do not have mobile data to access the QR Code in MyICA mobile app?\nAnswer 4: The QR code generation works in offline mode.Travellers can still create and retrieve the QR code for self-scanning at the immigration counters, even if travellers do not have mobile data.For a smooth journey, travellers are advised to generate their individual or group QR code before their arrival at Singapore land checkpoints.\n",

Where applicable, they should also check with the airline to ensure that they are allowed to board the plane as airlines have the prerogative to issue boarding passes to their passengers.As Singapore’s border measures and entry requirements will evolve as the global situation changes, please visit the MOH website and ICA website for the latest updates on travel and health control measures.It is important for a long-term pass holder to renew his/her foreign passport if it is expiring. Ensuring that a passport remains valid will allow ICA to determine his/her foreign citizenship.For all matters relating to foreign passport, please approach the respective Embassy/Consulate/Overseas Mission in Singapore.Once a new passport is obtained, a long-term pass holder will need to update his/her new passport details with the relevant issuing authority accordingly.ICA-issued Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders are required to update his/her new passport details with ICA accordingly once he/she has been issued with a new passport.\n",

            "question": "Can Long-Term Pass Holders still travel with a passport which is expiring in 6 months' time or less?",
            "answer": "Generally, as long as long-term passes (i.e. Student's Pass, Long Term Visit Pass, Work Permit, Employment Pass and Dependant’s Pass, etc.) are valid, the pass holders are able to use their current valid passport upon seeking arrival and departure immigration clearance at the Singapore checkpoints.However, they are advised to be mindful of the immigration requirements of any country they wish to depart, visit or place of return when travelling on a passport that is less than six months valid before embarking on their journey. Where applicable, they should also check with the airline to ensure that they are allowed to board the plane as airlines have the prerogative to issue boarding passes to their passengers.As Singapore’s border measures and entry requirements will evolve as the global situation changes, please visit the MOH website and ICA website for the latest updates on travel and health control measures.It is important for a long-term pass holder to renew his/her foreign passport if it is expiring. Ensuring that a passport remains valid will allow ICA to determine his/her foreign citizenship.For all matters relating to foreign passport, please approach the respective Embassy/Consulate/Overseas Mission in Singapore.Once a new passport is obtained, a long-term pass holder will need to update his/her new passport details with the relevant issuing authority accordingly.ICA-issued Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders are required to update his/her new passport details with ICA accordingly once he/she has been issued with a new passport.",

The period of stay granted is shown on the visit pass endorsement given on the passport or the electronic Visit Pass (e-Pass) issued to you through email. You can visit the e-Pass portal or use the Visit Pass Validity Tool to check the expiry of your e-Pass or visit pass.

            "answer": "A valid Singapore visa is not an immigration pass. A valid entry visa is a pre-entry requirement that you must apply for before travelling to seek entry into Singapore if you hold a travel document issued by one of the following countries/places listed on ICA website.Possessing a valid visa does not guarantee entry into Singapore. You will have to satisfy the basic entry requirements (https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart/entering-singapore) before being considered for entry into Singapore.The grant of a visit pass is determined by the ICA officers at the point of entry. The period of stay granted is shown on the visit pass endorsement given on the passport or the electronic Visit Pass (e-Pass) issued to you through email. You can visit the e-Pass portal or use the Visit Pass Validity Tool to check the expiry of your e-Pass or visit pass. Please note that the period of stay is not tied to the validity of your entry visa.You may refer to ICA website for more information should you require to extend your visit pass.",
