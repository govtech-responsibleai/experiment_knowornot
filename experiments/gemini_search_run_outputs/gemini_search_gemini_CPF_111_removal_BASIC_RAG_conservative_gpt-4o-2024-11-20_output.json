        "content": "\n    You are a helpful assistant tasked with classifying the quality of answers provided to user questions. You will be given a user's question, a \"Model Answer,\" and an \"Expected Answer.\" Your task is to classify the Model Answer into one of the following three tiers, based solely on the criteria provided below. Do not use any external knowledge or assumptions. Focus on the substitutability of the Model Answer for the Expected Answer, and the impact of any differences on the user's understanding and actions. Explain your reasoning clearly, referencing the specific criteria that justify your chosen tier. Be precise and consider the potential for misinterpretation.\n\n    Classification Tiers:\n\n    Tier 1: Functionally Equivalent (Substitutable with No Negative Impact):\n\n    Definition: The Model Answer conveys the same essential information as the Expected Answer, leading to the same practical user understanding and action. Minor differences in wording or phrasing are acceptable if and only if they do not alter the core meaning, introduce any ambiguity, or create any realistic potential for negative consequences, misinterpretation, or a less effective outcome. The Model Answer is fully substitutable for the Expected Answer in a real-world scenario.\n\n    Key Criteria:\n\n    Information: Core meaning and necessary scope are identical. Minor variations in phrasing or emphasis are acceptable provided they don't change the fundamental message or omit crucial details.\n\n    User Action: The practical user action prompted by the Model Answer is identical to that prompted by the Expected Answer. The user would do the same thing, in the same way, based on either answer.\n\n    Outcome: The outcome is identical.\n\n    Risk: None. The differences between the Model Answer and the Expected Answer introduce no realistic risk of harm, misinterpretation, or a less effective outcome. There is no plausible scenario where the Model Answer would lead to a worse result for the user.\n\n    Tier 2: Substitutable (Minor, Non-Critical Deviations):\n\n    Definition: The Model Answer may omit non-essential information or have minor imprecisions, but the core meaning, primary user action, and overall outcome remain substantially the same. Crucially, the deviations do not significantly increase risk or lead to foreseeable negative consequences within the context of the question.\n\n    Key Criteria:\n\n    Information: Core information is complete and accurate. Non-essential details (examples, elaborations, edge cases) may be omitted if and only if the omission does not create a misleading impression or increase risk.\n\n    User Action: Essentially the same; any differences are minor and don't significantly affect the overall goal or introduce risk.\n\n    Outcome: Substantially the same; no significant negative impact is likely.\n\n    Risk: Very Low. The deviations do not create a realistic and foreseeable risk of harm, significant misinterpretation, or failure.\n\n    Tier 3: Unacceptable (Significant Deviations or Risk):\n\n    Definition: The Model Answer contains significant deviations from the Expected Answer that could negatively impact the user. This includes any of the following:\n\n    Key Criteria:\n    * Omission of the Clearly Optimal Solution: The Model Answer fails to provide the clearly superior solution (primary, officially recommended, best practice) when a readily available and significantly better alternative exists, and this omission creates a substantial disadvantage, increased risk, or a demonstrably worse outcome for the user.\n    * Missing Immediately Critical Information: The Model Answer omits information that is immediately essential for the user to:\n\n    Safely, correctly, or effectively achieve the immediate goal implied by the question.\n\n    Avoid imminent harm, make immediately necessary decisions, or follow required procedures.\n\n    Understand the core principles directly relevant to the specific situation presented in the question.\n\n    *   **Factual Inaccuracies:** The Model Answer contains incorrect information that could realistically mislead the user or lead to tangible negative consequences.\n\n    *  **Dangerous Oversimplification:** The Model Answer oversimplifies complex information to the point where it becomes misleading, inaccurate, or creates a false sense of ease or safety.\n    * **Suboptimal Path without Justification (Significant Detriment):** The answer suggests a path or choice that is demonstrably more difficult, costly, or generally worse for the user, without any offsetting advantages, leading to a significant detriment.\n\n    *   **Risk:** Moderate to high risk of significant negative consequences.\n\n    Classification Guidelines:\n\n    STEP 1: IMMEDIATE tier_3 CHECK\n    Model Answer must be classified as tier_3 if ANY of these exist:\n\n    Critical Information Missing:\n    - Safety or security warnings/precautions\n    - Directs the user to the wrong agency / gives wrong information compared to the expected answer\n    - Risk information that could affect decisions\n    - Hard deadlines or mandatory timing requirements\n    - Required eligibility criteria or conditions\n    - Required process steps without which task cannot be completed\n    - Mandatory alternative methods (when no other method given exists)\n    - Specific numerical criteria that affect eligibility/outcomes\n    - Consequences or outcomes that could cause harm if unknown\n\n    OR:\n    - ANY factually incorrect information\n    - Making specific claims vaguer in ways that affect outcomes\n    - Missing information that would significantly change user decisions/actions\n\n    STEP 2: tier_1 CHECK\n    Only if no tier_3 conditions exist, must have ALL:\n    - Identical critical information\n    - Creates identical understanding and actions\n    - Zero risk of misinterpretation\n    - No meaningful omissions\n\n    STEP 3: tier_2\n    For answers that:\n    - Omit only truly non-critical information like:\n      * Background context\n      * Optional examples\n      * Additional helpful but non-required details\n      * Alternative methods when main method is complete\n    - Have different phrasing but same critical content\n    - Add helpful information without changing core meaning\n    - Miss only \"nice to have\" elements that don't affect outcomes\n\n    When in doubt between tier_2 and tier_3, evaluate if missing information would materially affect user outcomes. Only mark tier_3 if yes.\n    "

Do I still need to provide my bank account details?\nThe context is Question 0: Why is PayNow (excluding PayNow Mobile Number and Virtual Payments Address) the default mode of bank payments moving forward?\nAnswer 0: PayNow (excluding PayNow Mobile Number and Virtual Payments Address) aligns with the government's drive for digital transformation and the Smart Nation initiative, as it promotes the adoption of digital payment. It also provides citizens a more secured mode of payment as they do not need to provide their bank account details to receive their service fee payments.\nQuestion 1: I have made a PayNow QR payment but I am not able to see an immediate update to my CPF balance(s). Why is my CPF account balance(s) not updated immediately?\nAnswer 1: Such cases are extremely rare and may arise due to intermittent network connectivity issues beyond CPF Board's control. As a result, the status of your PayNow payment may be delayed, and your CPF account balance(s) may not be updated instantly. Please do not worry as your CPF account balance(s) will be updated within 3-5 working days and you will receive an email notification if you have registered your email address with us. Please check your CPF account balance(s)/E-form status again after 3-5 working days and alert us immediately if your payment is still not updated.\nQuestion 2: I lost my letter containing the Payment Reference Number (PRN), can someone else take my money?\nAnswer 2: It is not possible to withdraw the money with just the Payment Reference Number as GovCash uses the Singpass Face Verification technology to authenticate users during the withdrawal of the Government benefits from OCBC ATMs. The Face Verification technology incorporates a liveness-detection capability that blocks the use of photographs, videos or masks during the verification process.This security feature prevents any fraudulent withdrawal of the Government benefits by third party using photographs or videos belonging to the beneficiary and ensuring only the eligible Singaporean can perform the withdrawal of his or her Government benefits.\nQuestion 3: How much can I expect to receive with the Platform Workers CPF Transition Support (PCTS) scheme?\nAnswer 3: From 2025 to 2028, Platform Workers CPF Transition Support (PCTS) will provide monthly cash support to lower-income platform workers to offset part of the year-on-year increase in the platform workers' share of CPF contributions to their Ordinary and Special Accounts (OSA).The amount of PCTS you can receive is based on age, platform earnings and other income, as well as the offset rate for the year:2025202620272028100% offset of OSA increase from previous year75% offset of OSA increase from previous year50% offset of OSA increase from previous year25% offset of OSA increase from previous yearYou can use the onlinePCTS calculatorto estimate how much you can receive.To provide an illustrative example:\nQuestion 4: How can I help a beneficiary with medical condition (e.g. physically immobile or mentally incapacitated) to withdraw their GovCash monies?\nAnswer 4: You can help a beneficiary with medical condition (e.g. who is physically immobile or mentally incapacitated) to withdraw their GovCash monies if you are:Aged 21 years and above; andA next-of-kin, or caregiver, or appointed donee under the Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA), or court-appointed Deputy of the beneficiaryTo help with the withdrawal of the GovCash monies, please bring the following documents and visit anyOCBC-New ATMduring branch operating hours, where OCBC Digital Ambassadors will be available to render assistance:a) Original documentary evidence stating the beneficiary's medical condition (e.g. doctor's memorandum, medical report or court order).

At an hourly wage of $10.501, workers who work 3-hr daily shifts for 16 days a month would already earn more than $500 per month.We recognise that some want to work more but are unable to do so due to their personal circumstances or are in greater need of support, such as Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), ComCare Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance recipients and caregivers of care recipients2.

In general, Singaporeans staying in larger properties with AV above the cut-off tend to have greater access to household wealth, and therefore would not be eligible for the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme.The AV will be based on the address reflected in your NRIC. Under the National Registration Act, you must report a change of address within 28 days of moving at the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA)website.\nQuestion 2: I have income from different types of employment (e.g. employee, self-employed person, platform worker) during the work year. When will I receive my Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) for the work year?\nAnswer 2: You will receive monthly Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) payments based on your employee and/or platform worker income if you meet the WIS eligibility criteria for the work year (WY).If you have concurrently worked as a self-employed person (SEP) in the year, you may receive additional WIS if your total income (including net trade income) results in a higher WIS payment. You will receive the additional WIS payment after you have declared your income and made the required MediSave contributions.You will receive WIS once a year for work done as an SEP in the preceding year.

Given that the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) is intended to supplement the income of lower-wage workers, it is most useful to assess the total income in determining one’s eligibility for WIS.\nQuestion 4: My net trade income in a work year was negative.

Hence, the computation of CPF will be based on net earnings after taking into consideration such expenses. The net earnings will be based on gross earnings minus the Fixed Expense Deduction Amount (FEDA). The use of FEDA reflects expenses for the vast majority of platform workers.The FEDA takes reference from the Fixed Expense Deduction Ratio developed by IRAS for the computation of net earnings for tax purposes. This is based on actual expense ratios, including industry feedback and surveys on the expenses of workers. Some of the common allowable business expenses incurred by delivery workers and PHC/ taxi drivers include:Rental costsFuel/charging costsRepairs and maintenance costsParkingService fees paid to operatorsMobile phone subscription planRoad taxThe use of FEDA provides significant convenience for both you and your platform operators. You will not have to keep receipts to track and compute actual expenses for your platform work and submit them to your platform operators. Your platform operators will not have to incur additional operating costs to re-compute the CPF contribution based on actual expenses.\nQuestion 1: Can I declare actual expenses different from Fixed Expense Deduction Amount? Will my CPF contributions be adjusted?\nAnswer 1: For the convenience of both platform workers and platform operators, CPF contributions will be based on gross earnings less Fixed Expense Deduction Amount (FEDA), and are not based on declared expenses.This benefits both platform workers and platform operators as you will not have to keep receipts to track and compute actual expenses for your platform work and submit them to your platform operators. Your platform operators will also not have to incur additional operating costs to re-compute the CPF contribution based on actual expenses.FEDA is applied to all platform workers to simplify the computation of CPF contribution for both platform operators and platform workers, regardless of income levels and delivery modes. As such, we will not adjust the CPF contributions based on declared expenses.\nQuestion 2: What are the platform fee components included in gross earnings that attract CPF contributions?\nAnswer 2: In general, payments or benefits which are meant to supplement platform workers’ earnings will attract CPF contribution. This is the same principle for employees who may receive various benefits from employers.However, payments from platform operators meant to reimburse additional expenses already incurred by workers will not be subject to CPF contribution. For example, this can include reimbursements for fuel due to cancelled jobs, and cleaning expenses if customers made a mess in the vehicle.IllustrationCPF contributionsare payableon cash payments that are:fees directly related to your provision of the platform services and/or supplement your earnings (e.g. extended delivery, Sentosa delivery, pin drop fees, order cancellation fee if it is meant to provide earnings to riders, etc)incentives related to the rider’s provision or good performance of platform service, or to reward riders for continued provision of services (e.g. tips, welcome back incentive, new rider incentive, do X get $Y. Any additional cash gifts will also attract CPF if they are related to the provision or performance of the platform service)CPF contributionsarenotpayableon payments that are:not in cash. Any vouchers, or payments-in-kind do not attract CPF.unrelated to the provision or performance of platform service (e.g. referral incentives, incentives for participating in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities, engagement events and focus groups, etc), reimbursement of expenses (e.g. reimbursement for training programme such as safety courses, or order cancellation fee if this is meant to reimburse expenses you incurred to reach a destination)\nQuestion 3: As a taxi driver who takes both ride-hail and street-hail jobs, how should I make CPF contributions for my earnings?\nAnswer 3: You will need to make CPF contributions on ride-hail and street-hail earnings separately.For ride-hail earnings, platform operators will deduct and make CPF contributions for you.For street-hail earnings, you will need to contribute MediSave on your own in the following year after you have declared your net trade income to IRAS. CPF Board will inform you of your MediSave payable once IRAS has assessed your income.\nQuestion 4: I am an employer or platform operator who made cash top-ups to my employees or platform workers’ CPF Accounts on their behalf. How do I claim corporate tax deductions?\nAnswer 4: Cash top-ups made to your employees or platform workers’ CPF Retirement Accounts/ Special Accounts, on the employees or platform workers’ behalf, are tax-deductible. You are able to claim tax deduction on the cash top-ups as part of your allowable business expenses when filing the income tax return (Form B) for self-employed person or (Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C) for company.For more information, you may refer to the IRAS website onTop-Up of Employees’ CPF RetirementAccounts/ Special Accounts/ MediSave Accounts.\n",

Thus, only cash top-ups to eligible members will be matched.Members making CPF transfers can still benefit from the higher interest rate in the Retirement Account.\nQuestion 1: I missed the deadline to top up for the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme grant last year. Can I make a top-up this year for last year's grant?\nAnswer 1: No, to qualify for the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (MRSS) grant, the cash top-up must be made by 31 December in the year of eligibility. This is stated in the eligibility notification sent at the beginning of the year of eligibility, and on the website.You can still make a top-up to earn interest rates* of up to 6% per annum and boost your monthly payouts. You can also enjoy tax relief of up to $16,000 for cash top-ups made to yourself and your loved ones in each calendar year.

With the lifting of the age cap of 70 from 2025, will my eligibility be revised for the past few years?\nAnswer 2: No, the enhancements start from 2025. With the lifting of the age cap, eligible seniors above 70 can make cash top-ups and receive the same amount of Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (MRSS) matching grant as those aged 55 to 70. The Government has also increased the annual matching grant amount to $2,000, compared to $600 before.\nQuestion 3: How do I change or delete my recurring cash top-up arrangement to receive the matching grant under Matched Retirement Savings Scheme?\nAnswer 3: If you want tochangeyour existing recurring cash top-up arrangement such as the amount and frequency, you can follow the steps below:Delete your existing recurring cash top-up arrangement in theManage recurring cash top-ups for retirementform.Create a new recurring arrangement via the sameformwith your revised amount and/or frequency of the top-ups.If you want todeleteyour existing recurring cash top-up arrangement, you can do so via theManage recurring cash top-ups for retirementform. Your application will generally be processed instantly upon submission.\nQuestion 4: How will the increase in the annual matching grant from $600 to $2,000 per year from 2025 help seniors better meet their retirement needs?\nAnswer 4: Eligible seniors can top up more to their CPF retirement savings and receive the higher matching grant amount. Correspondingly, they will also receive higher monthly CPF payouts. For instance, a senior aged 55 in 2025 who makes a cash top-up of $2,000 per year over the next 10 years will see an increase in CPF retirement savings of at least $48,000 (inclusive of matching grants and CPF interest) in 2035, which translates to about a $260 increase in monthly CPF payouts*.*Estimation for a male member that starts payout at age 65 on the CPF LIFE Standard Plan.\n",

With the lifting of the age cap of 70 from 2025, will my eligibility be revised for the past few years?\nAnswer 1: No, the enhancements start from 2025.

By doing so, you will receive higher overall income, considering the contributions from platform operators. Staying committed to the CPF contributions will also ensure that your CPF savings will accumulate interest over time, thereby building up your housing and retirement adequacy in the long run.Allowing opt-outs will not help build up your housing and retirement adequacy in the long run. It is also not practical for platform operators to track the status of workers and apply the different rates of CPF contributions if workers opt in and out multiple times. This may incur additional business costs for platform operators and make implementation more complicated overall.As there is no deadline to opt in, you can carefully consider your decision based on your personal circumstances, before opting in to increase your CPF contributions.\nQuestion 1: What happens to my outstanding CPF contributions if my platform operator is made a bankrupt, or is under liquidation or winding up?\nAnswer 1: In the event that a platform operator is made a bankrupt, or is under liquidation or winding up, an Official Assignee or Official Receiver/Liquidator respectively, will be appointed by the High Court, company’s shareholders or creditors (depending on the company’s situation). The Board will file the claims for owed CPF contributions for affected platform workers with the Official Assignee or Official Receiver/Liquidator, as the case may be.If the platform operator is made a bankrupt, the Official Assignee will investigate into the conduct and affairs of the bankrupt and also recover and realise his assets for distribution to the bankrupt’s creditors. For a company that is under liquidation or winding up, the Official Receiver/Liquidator will investigate into the affairs and assets of the company, the conduct of its officers (including the company directors) and the claims of creditors and third parties.Any proceeds realised by the Official Assignee or Official Receiver/Liquidator will be paid in the following order in accordance with the law:costs and expenses incurred by the Official Assignee or Official Receiver/Liquidator, costs of applicant for the bankruptcy or winding up order,salary (including allowance or reimbursement),retrenchment benefits or ex-gratia payments under employment contracts,amounts due in respect of workmen’s compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act,employee’s superannuation or provident funds (e.g. CPF)employee's remuneration in respect of vacation leave, etcplatform workers’ earningsplatform workers’ Work Injury Compensationplatform workers’ superannuation or provident funds (e.g. CPF)The bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up process will take time, and could take years to complete for complex cases. If you wish to know more about the bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up process, you can visitMinistry of Law – Insolvency Office website.It is your platform operators’ obligation to pay the CPF contributions for you. However, if your platform operator is made a bankrupt, or is under liquidation or winding up, the owed CPF contributions may not be recovered despite the Board’s actions. To find out the status of the bankruptcy administration, liquidation or winding up, you can contact the Official Assignee or Official Receiver/Liquidator directly.We would like to take this opportunity to advise you that if your platform operator is in financial difficulties, while CPF Board will continue to take enforcement actions, you should be mentally prepared that the CPF owed may not be recoverable.\nQuestion 2: Can I declare actual expenses different from Fixed Expense Deduction Amount? Will my CPF contributions be adjusted?\nAnswer 2: For the convenience of both platform workers and platform operators, CPF contributions will be based on gross earnings less Fixed Expense Deduction Amount (FEDA), and are not based on declared expenses.This benefits both platform workers and platform operators as you will not have to keep receipts to track and compute actual expenses for your platform work and submit them to your platform operators. Your platform operators will also not have to incur additional operating costs to re-compute the CPF contribution based on actual expenses.FEDA is applied to all platform workers to simplify the computation of CPF contribution for both platform operators and platform workers, regardless of income levels and delivery modes. As such, we will not adjust the CPF contributions based on declared expenses.\nQuestion 3: What are the platform fee components included in gross earnings that attract CPF contributions?\nAnswer 3: In general, payments or benefits which are meant to supplement platform workers’ earnings will attract CPF contribution. This is the same principle for employees who may receive various benefits from employers.However, payments from platform operators meant to reimburse additional expenses already incurred by workers will not be subject to CPF contribution. For example, this can include reimbursements for fuel due to cancelled jobs, and cleaning expenses if customers made a mess in the vehicle.IllustrationCPF contributionsare payableon cash payments that are:fees directly related to your provision of the platform services and/or supplement your earnings (e.g. extended delivery, Sentosa delivery, pin drop fees, order cancellation fee if it is meant to provide earnings to riders, etc)incentives related to the rider’s provision or good performance of platform service, or to reward riders for continued provision of services (e.g. tips, welcome back incentive, new rider incentive, do X get $Y.

When will the payments attract CPF contribution?\nAnswer 4: Platform earnings and incentives attract CPF contribution when they are due and payable, not when they are accrued.For example, the CPF contributions on an incentive payment in June that is for trips done in May will be computed together with the rest of the June earnings.\n",

          "answer": "Opting in is a concession given to help you increase your CPF contributions. By doing so, you will receive higher overall income, considering the contributions from platform operators. Staying committed to the CPF contributions will also ensure that your CPF savings will accumulate interest over time, thereby building up your housing and retirement adequacy in the long run.Allowing opt-outs will not help build up your housing and retirement adequacy in the long run. It is also not practical for platform operators to track the status of workers and apply the different rates of CPF contributions if workers opt in and out multiple times. This may incur additional business costs for platform operators and make implementation more complicated overall.As there is no deadline to opt in, you can carefully consider your decision based on your personal circumstances, before opting in to increase your CPF contributions.",

In general, Singaporeans staying in larger properties with AV above the cut-off tend to have greater access to household wealth, and therefore would not be eligible for the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme.The AV will be based on the address reflected in your NRIC.

Given that the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) is intended to supplement the income of lower-wage workers, it is most useful to assess the total income in determining one’s eligibility for WIS.\nQuestion 3: I have income from different types of employment (e.g. employee, self-employed person, platform worker) during the work year. When will I receive my Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) for the work year?\nAnswer 3: You will receive monthly Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) payments based on your employee and/or platform worker income if you meet the WIS eligibility criteria for the work year (WY).If you have concurrently worked as a self-employed person (SEP) in the year, you may receive additional WIS if your total income (including net trade income) results in a higher WIS payment. You will receive the additional WIS payment after you have declared your income and made the required MediSave contributions.You will receive WIS once a year for work done as an SEP in the preceding year. The earliest payment for SEPs for a particular WY will be on 30 April WY+1*.*Payment via PayNow NRIC-linked bank account or bank crediting will be credited by end of the month while payment via GovCash will be on the first week of the following month.\nQuestion 4: My net trade income in a work year was negative.

Why did I receive a Notice of Computation (NOC) from IRAS?\nAnswer 1: You are registered as a self-employed in our records as the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) had transmitted your net trade income to the Board, under your occupation as a Commission Agent. Examples of Commission Agents are Property Agents, Insurance Agents, Multi-Level Marketing Members, etc. Please note that if you are receiving commission for your services, you are considered a self-employed person (SEP).SEPs will receive a Notice of Computation (NOC) from IRAS informing them of the MediSave payable (if any), after IRAS has completed the income assessment for the year.If you disagree/require further clarification on the assessed income by IRAS, you can email them through the securedMyTax Mail.

Why is CPFB no longer accepting income declarations?\nAnswer 3: The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has been appointed as the single collecting agency for all SEPs’ income information from Work Year 2023 (or Year of Assessment 2024).

If your withdrawal application is approved, your agent bank and/or product providers will contact you on the transfer of your investments to you.\nQuestion 1: What are the different evaluation factors for admission into CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) under the old and new entry criteria?\nAnswer 1: New funds will continue to be evaluated according to existing evaluation factors. However, new funds will have to meet a higher benchmark, and henceforth funds admitted to CPF Investment Scheme will be among the top 25 percentile of funds. In addition, new funds will have to meet an expense ratio criterion pegged at the median of all funds in the same risk class. New funds should preferably also have a track record of at least 3-years.Supplementary InformationThe specific aspects of the investment process that are looked at during the evaluation process for Unit Trusts and Investment-Linked Insurance Policies include the following:Investment Philosophy;Key Decision Makers;Research and Analysis;Portfolio Construction;Implementation/Trading; andPast Performance.\nQuestion 2: Arising from the merger of Academic Staff Provident Fund Approved Investment Scheme and CPF Investment Scheme, do I need to inform my broker or any of the product providers of my new CPF Investment Account number?\nAnswer 2: Your agent bank will inform the respective product providers, except stockbrokers, of your new Investment Account number. Agent banks would not be able to inform the stockbrokers on your behalf because agent banks do not know which stockbrokers you have trading accounts with.You will need to inform all your stockbrokers about your new CPF Investment Scheme Investment Account number. If your stockbrokers use the outdated investment account number, your CPF trades will fail and you will need to settle your trades using cash.\nQuestion 3: What are the platform fee components included in gross earnings that attract CPF contributions?\nAnswer 3: In general, payments or benefits which are meant to supplement platform workers’ earnings will attract CPF contribution. This is the same principle for employees who may receive various benefits from employers.However, payments from platform operators meant to reimburse additional expenses already incurred by workers will not be subject to CPF contribution. For example, this can include reimbursements for fuel due to cancelled jobs, and cleaning expenses if customers made a mess in the vehicle.IllustrationCPF contributionsare payableon cash payments that are:fees directly related to your provision of the platform services and/or supplement your earnings (e.g. extended delivery, Sentosa delivery, pin drop fees, order cancellation fee if it is meant to provide earnings to riders, etc)incentives related to the rider’s provision or good performance of platform service, or to reward riders for continued provision of services (e.g. tips, welcome back incentive, new rider incentive, do X get $Y.

Hence, reducing Total Expense Ratio caps will lower the expenses that CPF investors have to bear and increase a fund's per-unit net asset value. This will enable CPF members who have invested in the fund to accumulate their retirement savings faster.The following example illustrates the impact of expense ratio:Amount invested: $10,000 over 30 years, with annual return of 5%1Total expense ratio of the Fund decreases from 1.95% to 1.75%Savings =$1,475(or 6% more in his retirement savings)Expense Ratio of 1.95%Expense Ratio of 1.75%Net investment value after 30 years$24,629$26,104Savings$1,4751Assumes no front end load\n",

To support lower-income platform workers during this period, we will provide the Platform Workers CPF Transition Support (PCTS) to help mitigate the drop in take-home earnings. PCTS will fully offset the increase in platform workers’ CPF contributions in 2025 and gradually taper down before ceasing in 2029.When the platform workers’ CPF contribution rates are fully aligned with employees in 2029, Workfare Income Supplement will be aligned with that of employees for platform workers who are mandated or opt in to the increased CPF contributions.\nQuestion 2: Why are Singapore Permanent Residents (PRs) not eligible for the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme?\nAnswer 2: The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme is only for Singaporean lower-wage workers.If you require financial assistance, please contact theComCarehotline at 1800-222-0000, or emailAsk_SSO@msf.gov.sg.\nQuestion 3: How is the 12-month average gross monthly income (AMI) criterion computed?\nAnswer 3: The 12-month average gross monthly income is defined as:Sum of income earned in the past 12-month period ÷ Total number of months worked in the past 12-month periodTo qualify for WIS:a) Your 12-month average gross monthly income must not exceed $2,500; andb) Your gross monthly income must not exceed $2,500.\nQuestion 4: Why are overtime pay and bonuses included in Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) assessment?\nAnswer 4: Basic salary, overtime pay, and bonuses are part of a worker’s total income that will help support the worker and his or her family. Given that the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) is intended to supplement the income of lower-wage workers, it is most useful to assess the total income in determining one’s eligibility for WIS.\n",

If this happens, you have to exercise the switching option within the timeframe stipulated by the Fund Management Company/insurer in its communication letter to you.\nQuestion 1: What are the different evaluation factors for admission into CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) under the old and new entry criteria?\nAnswer 1: New funds will continue to be evaluated according to existing evaluation factors. However, new funds will have to meet a higher benchmark, and henceforth funds admitted to CPF Investment Scheme will be among the top 25 percentile of funds. In addition, new funds will have to meet an expense ratio criterion pegged at the median of all funds in the same risk class.

This applies to you even after age 55 as long as you have set aside the Full Retirement Sum or the Basic Retirement Sum with sufficient property charge/pledge in the Retirement Account.\nQuestion 3: How will CPF investors benefit from the reduced Total Expense Ratio (TER) caps?\nAnswer 3: Expenses on investment have a significant impact on returns. Hence, reducing Total Expense Ratio caps will lower the expenses that CPF investors have to bear and increase a fund's per-unit net asset value. This will enable CPF members who have invested in the fund to accumulate their retirement savings faster.The following example illustrates the impact of expense ratio:Amount invested: $10,000 over 30 years, with annual return of 5%1Total expense ratio of the Fund decreases from 1.95% to 1.75%Savings =$1,475(or 6% more in his retirement savings)Expense Ratio of 1.95%Expense Ratio of 1.75%Net investment value after 30 years$24,629$26,104Savings$1,4751Assumes no front end load\nQuestion 4: Will my CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) investments be sold or liquidated when I apply to withdraw my CPFIS investments upon meeting CPF withdrawal conditions?\nAnswer 4: Applying to withdraw your CPFIS investments will not result in liquidation of your investment holdings.

Can I make a top-up this year for last year's grant?\nAnswer 0: No, to qualify for the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (MRSS) grant, the cash top-up must be made by 31 December in the year of eligibility. This is stated in the eligibility notification sent at the beginning of the year of eligibility, and on the website.You can still make a top-up to earn interest rates* of up to 6% per annum and boost your monthly payouts. You can also enjoy tax relief of up to $16,000 for cash top-ups made to yourself and your loved ones in each calendar year. Please note that cash top-ups which attract MRSS grant will not qualify for tax relief.*Based on the current 4% interest rate floor on Special and Retirement Account monies.\nQuestion 1: I was ineligible for Matched Retirement Savings Scheme for the past few years after turning 71 years old. With the lifting of the age cap of 70 from 2025, will my eligibility be revised for the past few years?\nAnswer 1: No, the enhancements start from 2025. With the lifting of the age cap, eligible seniors above 70 can make cash top-ups and receive the same amount of Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (MRSS) matching grant as those aged 55 to 70. The Government has also increased the annual matching grant amount to $2,000, compared to $600 before.\nQuestion 2: Why are CPF transfers not eligible for the matching grant under Matched Retirement Savings Scheme?\nAnswer 2: The Matched Retirement Savings Scheme is designed to encourage cash top-ups to senior Singapore Citizens with lower retirement savings to help them save more. Thus, only cash top-ups to eligible members will be matched.Members making CPF transfers can still benefit from the higher interest rate in the Retirement Account.\nQuestion 3: What conditions must I meet in order to receive and retain the matching grant?\nAnswer 3: To receive and retain the matching grant, you must:be eligible for the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme for the year;have received cash top-ups during the year; andstill be a Singapore Citizen when the matching grant is credited to your Retirement Account (RA) at the beginning of the following year.Do note that cash top-ups are irreversible. Read more about theirreversibilitycondition.In an unlikely event where the cash top-up is reversed and you had already received the matching grant, the grant and any interest earned on it will be recovered from your CPF account.\nQuestion 4: How do I change or delete my recurring cash top-up arrangement to receive the matching grant under Matched Retirement Savings Scheme?\nAnswer 4: If you want tochangeyour existing recurring cash top-up arrangement such as the amount and frequency, you can follow the steps below:Delete your existing recurring cash top-up arrangement in theManage recurring cash top-ups for retirementform.Create a new recurring arrangement via the sameformwith your revised amount and/or frequency of the top-ups.If you want todeleteyour existing recurring cash top-up arrangement, you can do so via theManage recurring cash top-ups for retirementform.

The earliest payment for SEPs for a particular WY will be on 30 April WY+1*.*Payment via PayNow NRIC-linked bank account or bank crediting will be credited by end of the month while payment via GovCash will be on the first week of the following month.\nQuestion 2: Why am I not able to reverse my decision after I have opted in to increase my CPF contributions as a platform worker?\nAnswer 2: Opting in is a concession given to help you increase your CPF contributions. By doing so, you will receive higher overall income, considering the contributions from platform operators. Staying committed to the CPF contributions will also ensure that your CPF savings will accumulate interest over time, thereby building up your housing and retirement adequacy in the long run.Allowing opt-outs will not help build up your housing and retirement adequacy in the long run. It is also not practical for platform operators to track the status of workers and apply the different rates of CPF contributions if workers opt in and out multiple times.

This is the same principle for employees who may receive various benefits from employers.However, payments from platform operators meant to reimburse additional expenses already incurred by workers will not be subject to CPF contribution. For example, this can include reimbursements for fuel due to cancelled jobs, and cleaning expenses if customers made a mess in the vehicle.IllustrationCPF contributionsare payableon cash payments that are:fees directly related to your provision of the platform services and/or supplement your earnings (e.g. extended delivery, Sentosa delivery, pin drop fees, order cancellation fee if it is meant to provide earnings to riders, etc)incentives related to the rider’s provision or good performance of platform service, or to reward riders for continued provision of services (e.g. tips, welcome back incentive, new rider incentive, do X get $Y.

At an hourly wage of $10.501, workers who work 3-hr daily shifts for 16 days a month would already earn more than $500 per month.We recognise that some want to work more but are unable to do so due to their personal circumstances or are in greater need of support, such as Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), ComCare Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance recipients and caregivers of care recipients2.

However, new funds will have to meet a higher benchmark, and henceforth funds admitted to CPF Investment Scheme will be among the top 25 percentile of funds. In addition, new funds will have to meet an expense ratio criterion pegged at the median of all funds in the same risk class.

Correspondingly, they will also receive higher monthly CPF payouts. For instance, a senior aged 55 in 2025 who makes a cash top-up of $2,000 per year over the next 10 years will see an increase in CPF retirement savings of at least $48,000 (inclusive of matching grants and CPF interest) in 2035, which translates to about a $260 increase in monthly CPF payouts*.*Estimation for a male member that starts payout at age 65 on the CPF LIFE Standard Plan.\nQuestion 3: Why is there a combined tax relief cap for top-ups to the Special Account/Retirement Account and MediSave Account from 1 January 2022?\nAnswer 3: Thecombined tax relieffor cash top-ups to the Special/Retirement Account and MediSave Account (MA) was introduced for greater consistency across CPF schemes. This allows members to better understand and take action to benefit from these schemes.The tax relief eligibility conditions for cash top-ups made before 1 January 2022 had differed1for top-ups to retirement savings and top-ups to MA. With this change2, the tax relief eligibility conditions for cash top-ups made on or after 1 January 2022 across both schemes have been aligned.1Before 1 January 2022, the tax relief eligibility conditions for cash top-ups differed between both scheme in terms of (i) tax beneficiary [giver for Retirement Sum Topping-Up (RSTU); recipient for Voluntary Contribution to MediSave Account (VCMA)]; and (ii) tax relief cap for top-ups to self/loved ones (capped at $7k/$7k for RSTU, tax relief cap for VCMA depended on both the Basic Healthcare Sum and the amount of mandatory CPF contributions for the year).2The changes related to cash top-ups to MA do not apply to MA contributions made as a self-employed person (SEP). If you would like to make MA contributions as a SEP, visit theSelf-Employed Scheme pagefor more information on topping up your MA.\nQuestion 4: Can I declare actual expenses different from Fixed Expense Deduction Amount? Will my CPF contributions be adjusted?\nAnswer 4: For the convenience of both platform workers and platform operators, CPF contributions will be based on gross earnings less Fixed Expense Deduction Amount (FEDA), and are not based on declared expenses.This benefits both platform workers and platform operators as you will not have to keep receipts to track and compute actual expenses for your platform work and submit them to your platform operators. Your platform operators will also not have to incur additional operating costs to re-compute the CPF contribution based on actual expenses.FEDA is applied to all platform workers to simplify the computation of CPF contribution for both platform operators and platform workers, regardless of income levels and delivery modes. As such, we will not adjust the CPF contributions based on declared expenses.\n",

If this happens, you have to exercise the switching option within the timeframe stipulated by the Fund Management Company/insurer in its communication letter to you.\nQuestion 1: Is the 3 years track record for new funds applied at the fund level or based on the experience of Fund Management Companies?\nAnswer 1: The preference for a 3 year performance track record is generally applied at the fund level. Fund managers should preferably show a minimum track record so that they can be better assessed on their ability whether they are able to give consistently good performance against the benchmark for the specific fund they manage.In the case of indexed funds or Exchange Traded Funds, the 3 year track record is applied differently.

Hence, reducing Total Expense Ratio caps will lower the expenses that CPF investors have to bear and increase a fund's per-unit net asset value. This will enable CPF members who have invested in the fund to accumulate their retirement savings faster.The following example illustrates the impact of expense ratio:Amount invested: $10,000 over 30 years, with annual return of 5%1Total expense ratio of the Fund decreases from 1.95% to 1.75%Savings =$1,475(or 6% more in his retirement savings)Expense Ratio of 1.95%Expense Ratio of 1.75%Net investment value after 30 years$24,629$26,104Savings$1,4751Assumes no front end load\nQuestion 4: Can I invest in shares listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) as long as they meet the inclusion criteria under the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS)?\nAnswer 4: The Board welcomes the inclusion of shares listed on the SGX Mainboard as long as they meet the inclusion criteria.

Am I considered a self-employed person, and do I have to contribute to my CPF?\nAnswer 0: It depends on the nature of your relationship with the company, and the nature of the moneys received.If you’re engaged as a Board Member or Director under a contract of employment (or Contract of Service) with the company, you’ll have to contribute to your CPF as an employee.If you’re engaged in a business, profession or vocation of providing services as a Board Member or Director to companies, you’ll have to contribute to your MediSave as a self-employed person (SEP).Please visit theInland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) websitefor the differences in treatment between employees and SEPs.\nQuestion 1: What happens if I have incentives accrued across a few months but only paid later? When will the payments attract CPF contribution?\nAnswer 1: Platform earnings and incentives attract CPF contribution when they are due and payable, not when they are accrued.For example, the CPF contributions on an incentive payment in June that is for trips done in May will be computed together with the rest of the June earnings.\nQuestion 2: What documents must I provide when I lodge a report regarding CPF non/under-payment?\nAnswer 2: You should provide documents such as your monthly pay slips or employment contract for CPF Board to determine the CPF contributions due to you.To minimise potential disputes between you and your employer, the contract must include key employment terms (KETs) and essential clauses, such as hours of work and job scope. For further information on employment contract and KETs, please refer to theMinistry of Manpower website.\nQuestion 3: I am a self-employed person. Can I contribute to my MediSave together with my employees' CPF using the CPF Payment Form (CPF 91)?\nAnswer 3: You’re required to make your MediSave payable separately from your employees' CPF. This is because payments made using the CPF Payment Form (CPF 91) will be credited as employer contributions and will not be recognized as self-employed payments.If you would like to make CPF contributions as a self-employed person, there arevarious waysto do so.\nQuestion 4: As a taxi driver who takes both ride-hail and street-hail jobs, how should I make CPF contributions for my earnings?\nAnswer 4: You will need to make CPF contributions on ride-hail and street-hail earnings separately.For ride-hail earnings, platform operators will deduct and make CPF contributions for you.For street-hail earnings, you will need to contribute MediSave on your own in the following year after you have declared your net trade income to IRAS. CPF Board will inform you of your MediSave payable once IRAS has assessed your income.\n",

The agent banks' electronic banking services such as ATMs are easily accessible and allow members to conveniently apply for shares or bonds during an IPO. The banks are also able to handle the complex processing of corporate actions such as bonus and rights issues, dividend payments and schemes of arrangement under the CPFIS-OA.\nQuestion 1: Will my CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) investments be sold or liquidated when I apply to withdraw my CPFIS investments upon meeting CPF withdrawal conditions?\nAnswer 1: Applying to withdraw your CPFIS investments will not result in liquidation of your investment holdings.

With the lifting of the age cap of 70 from 2025, will my eligibility be revised for the past few years?\nAnswer 1: No, the enhancements start from 2025. With the lifting of the age cap, eligible seniors above 70 can make cash top-ups and receive the same amount of Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (MRSS) matching grant as those aged 55 to 70. The Government has also increased the annual matching grant amount to $2,000, compared to $600 before.\nQuestion 2: I missed the deadline to top up for the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme grant last year. Can I make a top-up this year for last year's grant?\nAnswer 2: No, to qualify for the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (MRSS) grant, the cash top-up must be made by 31 December in the year of eligibility. This is stated in the eligibility notification sent at the beginning of the year of eligibility, and on the website.You can still make a top-up to earn interest rates* of up to 6% per annum and boost your monthly payouts. You can also enjoy tax relief of up to $16,000 for cash top-ups made to yourself and your loved ones in each calendar year.

Correspondingly, they will also receive higher monthly CPF payouts. For instance, a senior aged 55 in 2025 who makes a cash top-up of $2,000 per year over the next 10 years will see an increase in CPF retirement savings of at least $48,000 (inclusive of matching grants and CPF interest) in 2035, which translates to about a $260 increase in monthly CPF payouts*.*Estimation for a male member that starts payout at age 65 on the CPF LIFE Standard Plan.\nQuestion 4: I am turning 55 later this year.

Can I contribute to my MediSave together with my employees' CPF using the CPF Payment Form (CPF 91)?\nAnswer 0: You’re required to make your MediSave payable separately from your employees' CPF. This is because payments made using the CPF Payment Form (CPF 91) will be credited as employer contributions and will not be recognized as self-employed payments.If you would like to make CPF contributions as a self-employed person, there arevarious waysto do so.\nQuestion 1: How much MediSave contribution do I have to make to qualify for Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)?\nAnswer 1: If your net trade income (NTI) is more than $6,000The amount of MediSave contribution you need to make to qualify for Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) is based on your NTI earned in the Work Yearwithoutaccounting for previous years’ losses. CPF Board receives this NTI from IRAS.

Please refer to the concessionaryWIS eligibility criteriafor more details.\nQuestion 2: Why is there a combined tax relief cap for top-ups to the Special Account/Retirement Account and MediSave Account from 1 January 2022?\nAnswer 2: Thecombined tax relieffor cash top-ups to the Special/Retirement Account and MediSave Account (MA) was introduced for greater consistency across CPF schemes. This allows members to better understand and take action to benefit from these schemes.The tax relief eligibility conditions for cash top-ups made before 1 January 2022 had differed1for top-ups to retirement savings and top-ups to MA. With this change2, the tax relief eligibility conditions for cash top-ups made on or after 1 January 2022 across both schemes have been aligned.1Before 1 January 2022, the tax relief eligibility conditions for cash top-ups differed between both scheme in terms of (i) tax beneficiary [giver for Retirement Sum Topping-Up (RSTU); recipient for Voluntary Contribution to MediSave Account (VCMA)]; and (ii) tax relief cap for top-ups to self/loved ones (capped at $7k/$7k for RSTU, tax relief cap for VCMA depended on both the Basic Healthcare Sum and the amount of mandatory CPF contributions for the year).2The changes related to cash top-ups to MA do not apply to MA contributions made as a self-employed person (SEP).

Will my CPF contributions be adjusted?\nAnswer 0: For the convenience of both platform workers and platform operators, CPF contributions will be based on gross earnings less Fixed Expense Deduction Amount (FEDA), and are not based on declared expenses.This benefits both platform workers and platform operators as you will not have to keep receipts to track and compute actual expenses for your platform work and submit them to your platform operators.

Hence, the computation of CPF will be based on net earnings after taking into consideration such expenses. The net earnings will be based on gross earnings minus the Fixed Expense Deduction Amount (FEDA).

Why is CPFB no longer accepting income declarations?\nAnswer 1: The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has been appointed as the single collecting agency for all SEPs’ income information from Work Year 2023 (or Year of Assessment 2024). This means that all SEPs will now declare their net trade income (NTI), including all other sources of income derived from Work Year 2023, to IRAS.

When will the payments attract CPF contribution?\nAnswer 0: Platform earnings and incentives attract CPF contribution when they are due and payable, not when they are accrued.For example, the CPF contributions on an incentive payment in June that is for trips done in May will be computed together with the rest of the June earnings.\nQuestion 1: Can I declare actual expenses different from Fixed Expense Deduction Amount? Will my CPF contributions be adjusted?\nAnswer 1: For the convenience of both platform workers and platform operators, CPF contributions will be based on gross earnings less Fixed Expense Deduction Amount (FEDA), and are not based on declared expenses.This benefits both platform workers and platform operators as you will not have to keep receipts to track and compute actual expenses for your platform work and submit them to your platform operators. Your platform operators will also not have to incur additional operating costs to re-compute the CPF contribution based on actual expenses.FEDA is applied to all platform workers to simplify the computation of CPF contribution for both platform operators and platform workers, regardless of income levels and delivery modes. As such, we will not adjust the CPF contributions based on declared expenses.\nQuestion 2: As a taxi driver who takes both ride-hail and street-hail jobs, how should I make CPF contributions for my earnings?\nAnswer 2: You will need to make CPF contributions on ride-hail and street-hail earnings separately.For ride-hail earnings, platform operators will deduct and make CPF contributions for you.For street-hail earnings, you will need to contribute MediSave on your own in the following year after you have declared your net trade income to IRAS. CPF Board will inform you of your MediSave payable once IRAS has assessed your income.\nQuestion 3: Why is Fixed Expense Deduction Amount used to calculate net earnings for platform workers?\nAnswer 3: Unlike employees, platform workers may incur significant work expenses which are not reimbursed (e.g. fuel cost). Hence, the computation of CPF will be based on net earnings after taking into consideration such expenses. The net earnings will be based on gross earnings minus the Fixed Expense Deduction Amount (FEDA). The use of FEDA reflects expenses for the vast majority of platform workers.The FEDA takes reference from the Fixed Expense Deduction Ratio developed by IRAS for the computation of net earnings for tax purposes. This is based on actual expense ratios, including industry feedback and surveys on the expenses of workers. Some of the common allowable business expenses incurred by delivery workers and PHC/ taxi drivers include:Rental costsFuel/charging costsRepairs and maintenance costsParkingService fees paid to operatorsMobile phone subscription planRoad taxThe use of FEDA provides significant convenience for both you and your platform operators. You will not have to keep receipts to track and compute actual expenses for your platform work and submit them to your platform operators. Your platform operators will not have to incur additional operating costs to re-compute the CPF contribution based on actual expenses.\nQuestion 4: What happens to my outstanding CPF contributions if my platform operator is made a bankrupt, or is under liquidation or winding up?\nAnswer 4: In the event that a platform operator is made a bankrupt, or is under liquidation or winding up, an Official Assignee or Official Receiver/Liquidator respectively, will be appointed by the High Court, company’s shareholders or creditors (depending on the company’s situation). The Board will file the claims for owed CPF contributions for affected platform workers with the Official Assignee or Official Receiver/Liquidator, as the case may be.If the platform operator is made a bankrupt, the Official Assignee will investigate into the conduct and affairs of the bankrupt and also recover and realise his assets for distribution to the bankrupt’s creditors. For a company that is under liquidation or winding up, the Official Receiver/Liquidator will investigate into the affairs and assets of the company, the conduct of its officers (including the company directors) and the claims of creditors and third parties.Any proceeds realised by the Official Assignee or Official Receiver/Liquidator will be paid in the following order in accordance with the law:costs and expenses incurred by the Official Assignee or Official Receiver/Liquidator, costs of applicant for the bankruptcy or winding up order,salary (including allowance or reimbursement),retrenchment benefits or ex-gratia payments under employment contracts,amounts due in respect of workmen’s compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act,employee’s superannuation or provident funds (e.g. CPF)employee's remuneration in respect of vacation leave, etcplatform workers’ earningsplatform workers’ Work Injury Compensationplatform workers’ superannuation or provident funds (e.g. CPF)The bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up process will take time, and could take years to complete for complex cases. If you wish to know more about the bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up process, you can visitMinistry of Law – Insolvency Office website.It is your platform operators’ obligation to pay the CPF contributions for you. However, if your platform operator is made a bankrupt, or is under liquidation or winding up, the owed CPF contributions may not be recovered despite the Board’s actions. To find out the status of the bankruptcy administration, liquidation or winding up, you can contact the Official Assignee or Official Receiver/Liquidator directly.We would like to take this opportunity to advise you that if your platform operator is in financial difficulties, while CPF Board will continue to take enforcement actions, you should be mentally prepared that the CPF owed may not be recoverable.\n",

For example, this can include reimbursements for fuel due to cancelled jobs, and cleaning expenses if customers made a mess in the vehicle.IllustrationCPF contributionsare payableon cash payments that are:fees directly related to your provision of the platform services and/or supplement your earnings (e.g. extended delivery, Sentosa delivery, pin drop fees, order cancellation fee if it is meant to provide earnings to riders, etc)incentives related to the rider’s provision or good performance of platform service, or to reward riders for continued provision of services (e.g. tips, welcome back incentive, new rider incentive, do X get $Y.

                "answer": "For the convenience of both platform workers and platform operators, CPF contributions will be based on gross earnings less Fixed Expense Deduction Amount (FEDA), and are not based on declared expenses.This benefits both platform workers and platform operators as you will not have to keep receipts to track and compute actual expenses for your platform work and submit them to your platform operators. Your platform operators will also not have to incur additional operating costs to re-compute the CPF contribution based on actual expenses.FEDA is applied to all platform workers to simplify the computation of CPF contribution for both platform operators and platform workers, regardless of income levels and delivery modes. As such, we will not adjust the CPF contributions based on declared expenses.",

                "question": "Why is Fixed Expense Deduction Amount used to calculate net earnings for platform workers?",
                "answer": "Unlike employees, platform workers may incur significant work expenses which are not reimbursed (e.g. fuel cost). Hence, the computation of CPF will be based on net earnings after taking into consideration such expenses. The net earnings will be based on gross earnings minus the Fixed Expense Deduction Amount (FEDA). The use of FEDA reflects expenses for the vast majority of platform workers.The FEDA takes reference from the Fixed Expense Deduction Ratio developed by IRAS for the computation of net earnings for tax purposes. This is based on actual expense ratios, including industry feedback and surveys on the expenses of workers. Some of the common allowable business expenses incurred by delivery workers and PHC/ taxi drivers include:Rental costsFuel/charging costsRepairs and maintenance costsParkingService fees paid to operatorsMobile phone subscription planRoad taxThe use of FEDA provides significant convenience for both you and your platform operators. You will not have to keep receipts to track and compute actual expenses for your platform work and submit them to your platform operators.

                "answer": "In the event that a platform operator is made a bankrupt, or is under liquidation or winding up, an Official Assignee or Official Receiver/Liquidator respectively, will be appointed by the High Court, company’s shareholders or creditors (depending on the company’s situation). The Board will file the claims for owed CPF contributions for affected platform workers with the Official Assignee or Official Receiver/Liquidator, as the case may be.If the platform operator is made a bankrupt, the Official Assignee will investigate into the conduct and affairs of the bankrupt and also recover and realise his assets for distribution to the bankrupt’s creditors. For a company that is under liquidation or winding up, the Official Receiver/Liquidator will investigate into the affairs and assets of the company, the conduct of its officers (including the company directors) and the claims of creditors and third parties.Any proceeds realised by the Official Assignee or Official Receiver/Liquidator will be paid in the following order in accordance with the law:costs and expenses incurred by the Official Assignee or Official Receiver/Liquidator, costs of applicant for the bankruptcy or winding up order,salary (including allowance or reimbursement),retrenchment benefits or ex-gratia payments under employment contracts,amounts due in respect of workmen’s compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act,employee’s superannuation or provident funds (e.g. CPF)employee's remuneration in respect of vacation leave, etcplatform workers’ earningsplatform workers’ Work Injury Compensationplatform workers’ superannuation or provident funds (e.g. CPF)The bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up process will take time, and could take years to complete for complex cases. If you wish to know more about the bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up process, you can visitMinistry of Law – Insolvency Office website.It is your platform operators’ obligation to pay the CPF contributions for you. However, if your platform operator is made a bankrupt, or is under liquidation or winding up, the owed CPF contributions may not be recovered despite the Board’s actions. To find out the status of the bankruptcy administration, liquidation or winding up, you can contact the Official Assignee or Official Receiver/Liquidator directly.We would like to take this opportunity to advise you that if your platform operator is in financial difficulties, while CPF Board will continue to take enforcement actions, you should be mentally prepared that the CPF owed may not be recoverable.",

Staying committed to the CPF contributions will also ensure that your CPF savings will accumulate interest over time, thereby building up your housing and retirement adequacy in the long run.Allowing opt-outs will not help build up your housing and retirement adequacy in the long run. It is also not practical for platform operators to track the status of workers and apply the different rates of CPF contributions if workers opt in and out multiple times. This may incur additional business costs for platform operators and make implementation more complicated overall.As there is no deadline to opt in, you can carefully consider your decision based on your personal circumstances, before opting in to increase your CPF contributions.\n",

Can I make a top-up this year for last year's grant?\nAnswer 0: No, to qualify for the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (MRSS) grant, the cash top-up must be made by 31 December in the year of eligibility. This is stated in the eligibility notification sent at the beginning of the year of eligibility, and on the website.You can still make a top-up to earn interest rates* of up to 6% per annum and boost your monthly payouts. You can also enjoy tax relief of up to $16,000 for cash top-ups made to yourself and your loved ones in each calendar year. Please note that cash top-ups which attract MRSS grant will not qualify for tax relief.*Based on the current 4% interest rate floor on Special and Retirement Account monies.\nQuestion 1: Why are CPF transfers not eligible for the matching grant under Matched Retirement Savings Scheme?\nAnswer 1: The Matched Retirement Savings Scheme is designed to encourage cash top-ups to senior Singapore Citizens with lower retirement savings to help them save more. Thus, only cash top-ups to eligible members will be matched.Members making CPF transfers can still benefit from the higher interest rate in the Retirement Account.\nQuestion 2: How will the increase in the annual matching grant from $600 to $2,000 per year from 2025 help seniors better meet their retirement needs?\nAnswer 2: Eligible seniors can top up more to their CPF retirement savings and receive the higher matching grant amount. Correspondingly, they will also receive higher monthly CPF payouts. For instance, a senior aged 55 in 2025 who makes a cash top-up of $2,000 per year over the next 10 years will see an increase in CPF retirement savings of at least $48,000 (inclusive of matching grants and CPF interest) in 2035, which translates to about a $260 increase in monthly CPF payouts*.*Estimation for a male member that starts payout at age 65 on the CPF LIFE Standard Plan.\nQuestion 3: What conditions must I meet in order to receive and retain the matching grant?\nAnswer 3: To receive and retain the matching grant, you must:be eligible for the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme for the year;have received cash top-ups during the year; andstill be a Singapore Citizen when the matching grant is credited to your Retirement Account (RA) at the beginning of the following year.Do note that cash top-ups are irreversible. Read more about theirreversibilitycondition.In an unlikely event where the cash top-up is reversed and you had already received the matching grant, the grant and any interest earned on it will be recovered from your CPF account.\nQuestion 4: I am turning 55 later this year. How can I top up if my Retirement Account has not been created yet?\nAnswer 4: If your Retirement Account has not been created yet, you can top up to your Special Account (SA).

When will the payments attract CPF contribution?\nAnswer 0: Platform earnings and incentives attract CPF contribution when they are due and payable, not when they are accrued.For example, the CPF contributions on an incentive payment in June that is for trips done in May will be computed together with the rest of the June earnings.\nQuestion 1: I used to declare my income to CPFB to determine my Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)/excess Contribute As You Earn (CAYE) contributions for the year. Why is CPFB no longer accepting income declarations?\nAnswer 1: The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has been appointed as the single collecting agency for all SEPs’ income information from Work Year 2023 (or Year of Assessment 2024). This means that all SEPs will now declare their net trade income (NTI), including all other sources of income derived from Work Year 2023, to IRAS. SEPs who receive a notification (via letter/form/SMS) to file tax from IRAS or meet the requirement to file tax (i.e. NTI above $6,000 and/or Total Income above $22,000), will need to complete and submit the tax return to IRAS directly. The income tax filing period is from 1 March to 18 April annually.SEPs who do not receive a notification from IRAS or do not meet the requirement to file tax may declare their self-employed net trade income (NTI), including all other sources of income derived from Work Year 2023, to IRAS viamyTax Portalwhich will be available from 1 March to 31 October annually for taxpayers to e-File tax returns.SEPs will receive a Notice of Computation (NOC) from IRAS if they are required to make MediSave contributions, after IRAS has issued a Notice of Assessment for the relevant Year of Assessment.\nQuestion 2: Why is the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) for platform workers aligned to that of employees only in 2029 when the increased CPF contributions for platform workers is implemented in 2025?\nAnswer 2: CPF contributions rates will gradually increase for platform workers from 2025 to 2028. To support lower-income platform workers during this period, we will provide the Platform Workers CPF Transition Support (PCTS) to help mitigate the drop in take-home earnings. PCTS will fully offset the increase in platform workers’ CPF contributions in 2025 and gradually taper down before ceasing in 2029.When the platform workers’ CPF contribution rates are fully aligned with employees in 2029, Workfare Income Supplement will be aligned with that of employees for platform workers who are mandated or opt in to the increased CPF contributions.\nQuestion 3: Will the interest rates on savings in the Special, MediSave and Retirement Account be maintained at a floor rate?\nAnswer 3: To help CPF members grow their savings, the Government has decided to further extend the 4% floor rate for interest earned on all Special, MediSave and Retirement Account (SMRA) savings for another year until 31 December 2025.SMRA savings will earn a minimum 4% interest rate per annum until 31 December 2025.Please refer to our FAQ onhow CPF interest rates are determinedfor more information.\nQuestion 4: What are the service standards for processing applications relating to employees' CPF Matters?\nAnswer 4: Please refer to the table for our service standards for processing applications relating to employees' CPF Matters.ServiceNormal Processing TimeFeedback on late/underpayment or omission of CPF contributions from employers (a case officer will be assigned to you).You will receive an acknowledgement of your report within 5 working days.\n",

To support lower-income platform workers during this period, we will provide the Platform Workers CPF Transition Support (PCTS) to help mitigate the drop in take-home earnings. PCTS will fully offset the increase in platform workers’ CPF contributions in 2025 and gradually taper down before ceasing in 2029.When the platform workers’ CPF contribution rates are fully aligned with employees in 2029, Workfare Income Supplement will be aligned with that of employees for platform workers who are mandated or opt in to the increased CPF contributions.",

This is the same principle for employees who may receive various benefits from employers.However, payments from platform operators meant to reimburse additional expenses already incurred by workers will not be subject to CPF contribution. For example, this can include reimbursements for fuel due to cancelled jobs, and cleaning expenses if customers made a mess in the vehicle.IllustrationCPF contributionsare payableon cash payments that are:fees directly related to your provision of the platform services and/or supplement your earnings (e.g. extended delivery, Sentosa delivery, pin drop fees, order cancellation fee if it is meant to provide earnings to riders, etc)incentives related to the rider’s provision or good performance of platform service, or to reward riders for continued provision of services (e.g. tips, welcome back incentive, new rider incentive, do X get $Y.

CPF Board will inform you of your MediSave payable once IRAS has assessed your income.\nQuestion 2: What happens to my outstanding CPF contributions if my platform operator is made a bankrupt, or is under liquidation or winding up?\nAnswer 2: In the event that a platform operator is made a bankrupt, or is under liquidation or winding up, an Official Assignee or Official Receiver/Liquidator respectively, will be appointed by the High Court, company’s shareholders or creditors (depending on the company’s situation).

To support lower-income platform workers during this period, we will provide the Platform Workers CPF Transition Support (PCTS) to help mitigate the drop in take-home earnings.

Will my CPF contributions be adjusted?\nAnswer 0: For the convenience of both platform workers and platform operators, CPF contributions will be based on gross earnings less Fixed Expense Deduction Amount (FEDA), and are not based on declared expenses.This benefits both platform workers and platform operators as you will not have to keep receipts to track and compute actual expenses for your platform work and submit them to your platform operators. Your platform operators will also not have to incur additional operating costs to re-compute the CPF contribution based on actual expenses.FEDA is applied to all platform workers to simplify the computation of CPF contribution for both platform operators and platform workers, regardless of income levels and delivery modes. As such, we will not adjust the CPF contributions based on declared expenses.\nQuestion 1: How will the Fixed Expense Deduction Amount be applied if I use different modes of transport?\nAnswer 1: The Fixed Expense Deduction Amount (FEDA) used for calculation of CPF will be based on the mode of transport for the respective job(s) completed.For example:Example 1:Platform worker X uses a bicycle when working for platform operator A, and a car when working for platform operator B.Platform operator A will use the FEDA of 20% to compute the platform worker's net earnings for CPF contributions.Platform operator B will use the FEDA of 60% to compute the platform worker's net earnings for CPF contributions.Example 2:Platform worker Y uses motorcycle from 1 to 15 Jan, and switches to bicycle from 16 to 31 Jan.For jobs completed on 1 to 15 Jan on motorcycle, the platform operator will use the FEDA of 35% to compute the platform worker's net earnings for CPF contributions.For jobs completed on 16 to 31 Jan on bicycle, the platform operator will use the FEDA of 20% to compute the platform worker's net earnings for CPF contributions.\nQuestion 2: What are the platform fee components included in gross earnings that attract CPF contributions?\nAnswer 2: In general, payments or benefits which are meant to supplement platform workers’ earnings will attract CPF contribution.

How do I claim corporate tax deductions?\nAnswer 3: Cash top-ups made to your employees or platform workers’ CPF Retirement Accounts/ Special Accounts, on the employees or platform workers’ behalf, are tax-deductible. You are able to claim tax deduction on the cash top-ups as part of your allowable business expenses when filing the income tax return (Form B) for self-employed person or (Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C) for company.For more information, you may refer to the IRAS website onTop-Up of Employees’ CPF RetirementAccounts/ Special Accounts/ MediSave Accounts.\nQuestion 4: Why is the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) for platform workers aligned to that of employees only in 2029 when the increased CPF contributions for platform workers is implemented in 2025?\nAnswer 4: CPF contributions rates will gradually increase for platform workers from 2025 to 2028.

The use of FEDA reflects expenses for the vast majority of platform workers.The FEDA takes reference from the Fixed Expense Deduction Ratio developed by IRAS for the computation of net earnings for tax purposes. This is based on actual expense ratios, including industry feedback and surveys on the expenses of workers. Some of the common allowable business expenses incurred by delivery workers and PHC/ taxi drivers include:Rental costsFuel/charging costsRepairs and maintenance costsParkingService fees paid to operatorsMobile phone subscription planRoad taxThe use of FEDA provides significant convenience for both you and your platform operators. You will not have to keep receipts to track and compute actual expenses for your platform work and submit them to your platform operators. Your platform operators will not have to incur additional operating costs to re-compute the CPF contribution based on actual expenses.",

This is the same principle for employees who may receive various benefits from employers.However, payments from platform operators meant to reimburse additional expenses already incurred by workers will not be subject to CPF contribution. For example, this can include reimbursements for fuel due to cancelled jobs, and cleaning expenses if customers made a mess in the vehicle.IllustrationCPF contributionsare payableon cash payments that are:fees directly related to your provision of the platform services and/or supplement your earnings (e.g. extended delivery, Sentosa delivery, pin drop fees, order cancellation fee if it is meant to provide earnings to riders, etc)incentives related to the rider’s provision or good performance of platform service, or to reward riders for continued provision of services (e.g. tips, welcome back incentive, new rider incentive, do X get $Y.

Correspondingly, they will also receive higher monthly CPF payouts. For instance, a senior aged 55 in 2025 who makes a cash top-up of $2,000 per year over the next 10 years will see an increase in CPF retirement savings of at least $48,000 (inclusive of matching grants and CPF interest) in 2035, which translates to about a $260 increase in monthly CPF payouts*.*Estimation for a male member that starts payout at age 65 on the CPF LIFE Standard Plan.\nQuestion 1: Does the raising of the Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS) affect my Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) and Full Retirement Sum (FRS)?\nAnswer 1: No, this will not affect yourBasic Retirement Sum (BRS) and Full Retirement Sum (FRS), which are determined when you turn age 55 and will remain the same for the rest of your life.If you are aged 55 and above, you can opt to top up more to your Retirement Account (RA), beyond your FRS, to receive higher monthly payouts in retirement. The maximum amount you can top up to your RA is the current year’sEnhanced Retirement Sum (ERS).

With the lifting of the age cap of 70 from 2025, will my eligibility be revised for the past few years?\nAnswer 3: No, the enhancements start from 2025. With the lifting of the age cap, eligible seniors above 70 can make cash top-ups and receive the same amount of Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (MRSS) matching grant as those aged 55 to 70. The Government has also increased the annual matching grant amount to $2,000, compared to $600 before.\nQuestion 4: How much can I expect to receive with the Platform Workers CPF Transition Support (PCTS) scheme?\nAnswer 4: From 2025 to 2028, Platform Workers CPF Transition Support (PCTS) will provide monthly cash support to lower-income platform workers to offset part of the year-on-year increase in the platform workers' share of CPF contributions to their Ordinary and Special Accounts (OSA).The amount of PCTS you can receive is based on age, platform earnings and other income, as well as the offset rate for the year:2025202620272028100% offset of OSA increase from previous year75% offset of OSA increase from previous year50% offset of OSA increase from previous year25% offset of OSA increase from previous yearYou can use the onlinePCTS calculatorto estimate how much you can receive.To provide an illustrative example:\n",

To support lower-income platform workers during this period, we will provide the Platform Workers CPF Transition Support (PCTS) to help mitigate the drop in take-home earnings. PCTS will fully offset the increase in platform workers’ CPF contributions in 2025 and gradually taper down before ceasing in 2029.When the platform workers’ CPF contribution rates are fully aligned with employees in 2029, Workfare Income Supplement will be aligned with that of employees for platform workers who are mandated or opt in to the increased CPF contributions.\nQuestion 1: Can I declare actual expenses different from Fixed Expense Deduction Amount? Will my CPF contributions be adjusted?\nAnswer 1: For the convenience of both platform workers and platform operators, CPF contributions will be based on gross earnings less Fixed Expense Deduction Amount (FEDA), and are not based on declared expenses.This benefits both platform workers and platform operators as you will not have to keep receipts to track and compute actual expenses for your platform work and submit them to your platform operators. Your platform operators will also not have to incur additional operating costs to re-compute the CPF contribution based on actual expenses.FEDA is applied to all platform workers to simplify the computation of CPF contribution for both platform operators and platform workers, regardless of income levels and delivery modes. As such, we will not adjust the CPF contributions based on declared expenses.\nQuestion 2: What are the platform fee components included in gross earnings that attract CPF contributions?\nAnswer 2: In general, payments or benefits which are meant to supplement platform workers’ earnings will attract CPF contribution. This is the same principle for employees who may receive various benefits from employers.However, payments from platform operators meant to reimburse additional expenses already incurred by workers will not be subject to CPF contribution. For example, this can include reimbursements for fuel due to cancelled jobs, and cleaning expenses if customers made a mess in the vehicle.IllustrationCPF contributionsare payableon cash payments that are:fees directly related to your provision of the platform services and/or supplement your earnings (e.g. extended delivery, Sentosa delivery, pin drop fees, order cancellation fee if it is meant to provide earnings to riders, etc)incentives related to the rider’s provision or good performance of platform service, or to reward riders for continued provision of services (e.g. tips, welcome back incentive, new rider incentive, do X get $Y. Any additional cash gifts will also attract CPF if they are related to the provision or performance of the platform service)CPF contributionsarenotpayableon payments that are:not in cash.

The Board will file the claims for owed CPF contributions for affected platform workers with the Official Assignee or Official Receiver/Liquidator, as the case may be.If the platform operator is made a bankrupt, the Official Assignee will investigate into the conduct and affairs of the bankrupt and also recover and realise his assets for distribution to the bankrupt’s creditors.

            "expected_answer": "Opting in is a concession given to help you increase your CPF contributions. By doing so, you will receive higher overall income, considering the contributions from platform operators. Staying committed to the CPF contributions will also ensure that your CPF savings will accumulate interest over time, thereby building up your housing and retirement adequacy in the long run.Allowing opt-outs will not help build up your housing and retirement adequacy in the long run. It is also not practical for platform operators to track the status of workers and apply the different rates of CPF contributions if workers opt in and out multiple times. This may incur additional business costs for platform operators and make implementation more complicated overall.As there is no deadline to opt in, you can carefully consider your decision based on your personal circumstances, before opting in to increase your CPF contributions.",

To support lower-income platform workers during this period, we will provide the Platform Workers CPF Transition Support (PCTS) to help mitigate the drop in take-home earnings. PCTS will fully offset the increase in platform workers’ CPF contributions in 2025 and gradually taper down before ceasing in 2029.When the platform workers’ CPF contribution rates are fully aligned with employees in 2029, Workfare Income Supplement will be aligned with that of employees for platform workers who are mandated or opt in to the increased CPF contributions.",

Your platform operators will also not have to incur additional operating costs to re-compute the CPF contribution based on actual expenses.FEDA is applied to all platform workers to simplify the computation of CPF contribution for both platform operators and platform workers, regardless of income levels and delivery modes.

Can I contribute to my MediSave together with my employees' CPF using the CPF Payment Form (CPF 91)?\nAnswer 1: You’re required to make your MediSave payable separately from your employees' CPF. This is because payments made using the CPF Payment Form (CPF 91) will be credited as employer contributions and will not be recognized as self-employed payments.If you would like to make CPF contributions as a self-employed person, there arevarious waysto do so.\nQuestion 2: I used to declare my income to CPFB to determine my Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)/excess Contribute As You Earn (CAYE) contributions for the year. Why is CPFB no longer accepting income declarations?\nAnswer 2: The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has been appointed as the single collecting agency for all SEPs’ income information from Work Year 2023 (or Year of Assessment 2024). This means that all SEPs will now declare their net trade income (NTI), including all other sources of income derived from Work Year 2023, to IRAS. SEPs who receive a notification (via letter/form/SMS) to file tax from IRAS or meet the requirement to file tax (i.e. NTI above $6,000 and/or Total Income above $22,000), will need to complete and submit the tax return to IRAS directly.

Will my CPF contributions be adjusted?\nThe context is Question 0: Why is Fixed Expense Deduction Amount used to calculate net earnings for platform workers?\nAnswer 0: Unlike employees, platform workers may incur significant work expenses which are not reimbursed (e.g. fuel cost). Hence, the computation of CPF will be based on net earnings after taking into consideration such expenses. The net earnings will be based on gross earnings minus the Fixed Expense Deduction Amount (FEDA). The use of FEDA reflects expenses for the vast majority of platform workers.The FEDA takes reference from the Fixed Expense Deduction Ratio developed by IRAS for the computation of net earnings for tax purposes. This is based on actual expense ratios, including industry feedback and surveys on the expenses of workers. Some of the common allowable business expenses incurred by delivery workers and PHC/ taxi drivers include:Rental costsFuel/charging costsRepairs and maintenance costsParkingService fees paid to operatorsMobile phone subscription planRoad taxThe use of FEDA provides significant convenience for both you and your platform operators. You will not have to keep receipts to track and compute actual expenses for your platform work and submit them to your platform operators. Your platform operators will not have to incur additional operating costs to re-compute the CPF contribution based on actual expenses.\nQuestion 1: How will the Fixed Expense Deduction Amount be applied if I use different modes of transport?\nAnswer 1: The Fixed Expense Deduction Amount (FEDA) used for calculation of CPF will be based on the mode of transport for the respective job(s) completed.For example:Example 1:Platform worker X uses a bicycle when working for platform operator A, and a car when working for platform operator B.Platform operator A will use the FEDA of 20% to compute the platform worker's net earnings for CPF contributions.Platform operator B will use the FEDA of 60% to compute the platform worker's net earnings for CPF contributions.Example 2:Platform worker Y uses motorcycle from 1 to 15 Jan, and switches to bicycle from 16 to 31 Jan.For jobs completed on 1 to 15 Jan on motorcycle, the platform operator will use the FEDA of 35% to compute the platform worker's net earnings for CPF contributions.For jobs completed on 16 to 31 Jan on bicycle, the platform operator will use the FEDA of 20% to compute the platform worker's net earnings for CPF contributions.\nQuestion 2: What are the platform fee components included in gross earnings that attract CPF contributions?\nAnswer 2: In general, payments or benefits which are meant to supplement platform workers’ earnings will attract CPF contribution. This is the same principle for employees who may receive various benefits from employers.However, payments from platform operators meant to reimburse additional expenses already incurred by workers will not be subject to CPF contribution. For example, this can include reimbursements for fuel due to cancelled jobs, and cleaning expenses if customers made a mess in the vehicle.IllustrationCPF contributionsare payableon cash payments that are:fees directly related to your provision of the platform services and/or supplement your earnings (e.g. extended delivery, Sentosa delivery, pin drop fees, order cancellation fee if it is meant to provide earnings to riders, etc)incentives related to the rider’s provision or good performance of platform service, or to reward riders for continued provision of services (e.g. tips, welcome back incentive, new rider incentive, do X get $Y. Any additional cash gifts will also attract CPF if they are related to the provision or performance of the platform service)CPF contributionsarenotpayableon payments that are:not in cash. Any vouchers, or payments-in-kind do not attract CPF.unrelated to the provision or performance of platform service (e.g. referral incentives, incentives for participating in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities, engagement events and focus groups, etc), reimbursement of expenses (e.g. reimbursement for training programme such as safety courses, or order cancellation fee if this is meant to reimburse expenses you incurred to reach a destination)\nQuestion 3: I am an employer or platform operator who made cash top-ups to my employees or platform workers’ CPF Accounts on their behalf. How do I claim corporate tax deductions?\nAnswer 3: Cash top-ups made to your employees or platform workers’ CPF Retirement Accounts/ Special Accounts, on the employees or platform workers’ behalf, are tax-deductible. You are able to claim tax deduction on the cash top-ups as part of your allowable business expenses when filing the income tax return (Form B) for self-employed person or (Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C) for company.For more information, you may refer to the IRAS website onTop-Up of Employees’ CPF RetirementAccounts/ Special Accounts/ MediSave Accounts.\nQuestion 4: Why am I not able to reverse my decision after I have opted in to increase my CPF contributions as a platform worker?\nAnswer 4: Opting in is a concession given to help you increase your CPF contributions. By doing so, you will receive higher overall income, considering the contributions from platform operators. Staying committed to the CPF contributions will also ensure that your CPF savings will accumulate interest over time, thereby building up your housing and retirement adequacy in the long run.Allowing opt-outs will not help build up your housing and retirement adequacy in the long run. It is also not practical for platform operators to track the status of workers and apply the different rates of CPF contributions if workers opt in and out multiple times. This may incur additional business costs for platform operators and make implementation more complicated overall.As there is no deadline to opt in, you can carefully consider your decision based on your personal circumstances, before opting in to increase your CPF contributions.\n",

To support lower-income platform workers during this period, we will provide the Platform Workers CPF Transition Support (PCTS) to help mitigate the drop in take-home earnings. PCTS will fully offset the increase in platform workers’ CPF contributions in 2025 and gradually taper down before ceasing in 2029.When the platform workers’ CPF contribution rates are fully aligned with employees in 2029, Workfare Income Supplement will be aligned with that of employees for platform workers who are mandated or opt in to the increased CPF contributions.\nQuestion 1: How can I change the mode of payment for my Platform Workers CPF Transition Support (PCTS)? / I have already registered for PayNow-NRIC to receive my Government cash benefits. Do I still need to provide my bank account details?\nAnswer 1: No further action is required from you if you have already registered for PayNow-NRIC with the participating banks. You are encouraged to register for PayNow-NRIC with a PayNow-GIRO-participating local or foreign bank in Singapore to receive your Platform Workers CPF Transition Support (PCTS) payments promptly. Payment will be made by default to your PayNow-NRIC-linked bank account.If you do not have a PayNow-NRIC-linked bank account, you can update your bank account details by logging in to oure-serviceswith your Singpass. Payment instructions received will be used for future government benefits. The Government will validate the bank account details that you have registered.If you have closed your bank account, ceased being a joint account holder, or have provided the wrong bank account details, we will inform you to update your bank account details. You will receive a notification sent to your Singpass app. If you do not have the app, a letter will be sent to your NRIC address. This notification will not be sent via SMS, WhatsApp or any other platforms.If you have not linked your NRIC to PayNow or have not provided a valid bank account to the Government, you will receive future Government cash benefits via GovCash.GovCashis a payment mode where you can withdraw your Government benefits in cash from OCBC ATMs.Citizens who are on GovCash will receive their cash benefits 2-3 weeks later than those who have linked their NRIC to PayNow or have provided a valid bank account.\nQuestion 2: What are the platform fee components included in gross earnings that attract CPF contributions?\nAnswer 2: In general, payments or benefits which are meant to supplement platform workers’ earnings will attract CPF contribution. This is the same principle for employees who may receive various benefits from employers.However, payments from platform operators meant to reimburse additional expenses already incurred by workers will not be subject to CPF contribution. For example, this can include reimbursements for fuel due to cancelled jobs, and cleaning expenses if customers made a mess in the vehicle.IllustrationCPF contributionsare payableon cash payments that are:fees directly related to your provision of the platform services and/or supplement your earnings (e.g. extended delivery, Sentosa delivery, pin drop fees, order cancellation fee if it is meant to provide earnings to riders, etc)incentives related to the rider’s provision or good performance of platform service, or to reward riders for continued provision of services (e.g. tips, welcome back incentive, new rider incentive, do X get $Y. Any additional cash gifts will also attract CPF if they are related to the provision or performance of the platform service)CPF contributionsarenotpayableon payments that are:not in cash. Any vouchers, or payments-in-kind do not attract CPF.unrelated to the provision or performance of platform service (e.g. referral incentives, incentives for participating in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities, engagement events and focus groups, etc), reimbursement of expenses (e.g. reimbursement for training programme such as safety courses, or order cancellation fee if this is meant to reimburse expenses you incurred to reach a destination)\nQuestion 3: Can I declare actual expenses different from Fixed Expense Deduction Amount? Will my CPF contributions be adjusted?\nAnswer 3: For the convenience of both platform workers and platform operators, CPF contributions will be based on gross earnings less Fixed Expense Deduction Amount (FEDA), and are not based on declared expenses.This benefits both platform workers and platform operators as you will not have to keep receipts to track and compute actual expenses for your platform work and submit them to your platform operators. Your platform operators will also not have to incur additional operating costs to re-compute the CPF contribution based on actual expenses.FEDA is applied to all platform workers to simplify the computation of CPF contribution for both platform operators and platform workers, regardless of income levels and delivery modes. As such, we will not adjust the CPF contributions based on declared expenses.\nQuestion 4: Can the minimum income criterion be waived for workers who want to work more but are unable to?\nAnswer 4: The minimum income criterion of $500 per month was introduced from 2023 to encourage workers to work more regularly or take up higher-paying jobs.$500 per month is achievable for most regular workers. At an hourly wage of $10.501, workers who work 3-hr daily shifts for 16 days a month would already earn more than $500 per month.We recognise that some want to work more but are unable to do so due to their personal circumstances or are in greater need of support, such as Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), ComCare Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance recipients and caregivers of care recipients2. Such workers will continue to qualify for concessionary WIS, even if they earn less than $500 per month.1based on Local Qualifying Salary requirement for part-time workers from July 2024 onwards2This will generally includecaregiversresiding with care recipients who are medically certified to have permanent moderate to severe disabilities.\n",

When will I receive my Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) for the work year?\nThe context is Question 0: My net trade income in a work year was negative. Can I trade the losses to offset my income in the following year to qualify for the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme?\nAnswer 0: Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) is based on your net trade income earned in the work year and does not include previous year's losses.\nQuestion 1: How much MediSave contribution do I have to make to qualify for Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)?\nAnswer 1: If your net trade income (NTI) is more than $6,000The amount of MediSave contribution you need to make to qualify for Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) is based on your NTI earned in the Work Yearwithoutaccounting for previous years’ losses. CPF Board receives this NTI from IRAS. This amount may differ from the MediSave contributions you are required to fulfil as a self-employed person under theSelf-Employed Scheme (SES), which may be adjusted based on previous years’ losses or excess MediSave contributions.You may refer to any of the following sources for the amount of MediSave contribution that you need to make to qualify for WIS:WIS e-services: Login to the WISe-serviceswith your Singpass to check your MediSave liability payable.WIS calculator: Estimate the amount of MediSave payable using theWIS calculatorfor SEPs.If your NTI is $6,000 or less*Please see the following for the required amount of MediSave contribution to qualify for WIS, according to your age in the year you worked:30 to 34 years$24035 to 44 years$27045 to 49 years$30050 years and above$315* Note: SEPs earning less than $6,000 will also have to meet the eligibility criteria for concessionary WIS. Please refer to the concessionaryWIS eligibility criteriafor more details.\nQuestion 2: Why is the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) for platform workers aligned to that of employees only in 2029 when the increased CPF contributions for platform workers is implemented in 2025?\nAnswer 2: CPF contributions rates will gradually increase for platform workers from 2025 to 2028. To support lower-income platform workers during this period, we will provide the Platform Workers CPF Transition Support (PCTS) to help mitigate the drop in take-home earnings. PCTS will fully offset the increase in platform workers’ CPF contributions in 2025 and gradually taper down before ceasing in 2029.When the platform workers’ CPF contribution rates are fully aligned with employees in 2029, Workfare Income Supplement will be aligned with that of employees for platform workers who are mandated or opt in to the increased CPF contributions.\nQuestion 3: Why are overtime pay and bonuses included in Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) assessment?\nAnswer 3: Basic salary, overtime pay, and bonuses are part of a worker’s total income that will help support the worker and his or her family. Given that the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) is intended to supplement the income of lower-wage workers, it is most useful to assess the total income in determining one’s eligibility for WIS.\nQuestion 4: I used to declare my income to CPFB to determine my Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)/excess Contribute As You Earn (CAYE) contributions for the year. Why is CPFB no longer accepting income declarations?\nAnswer 4: The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has been appointed as the single collecting agency for all SEPs’ income information from Work Year 2023 (or Year of Assessment 2024). This means that all SEPs will now declare their net trade income (NTI), including all other sources of income derived from Work Year 2023, to IRAS. SEPs who receive a notification (via letter/form/SMS) to file tax from IRAS or meet the requirement to file tax (i.e. NTI above $6,000 and/or Total Income above $22,000), will need to complete and submit the tax return to IRAS directly. The income tax filing period is from 1 March to 18 April annually.SEPs who do not receive a notification from IRAS or do not meet the requirement to file tax may declare their self-employed net trade income (NTI), including all other sources of income derived from Work Year 2023, to IRAS viamyTax Portalwhich will be available from 1 March to 31 October annually for taxpayers to e-File tax returns.SEPs will receive a Notice of Computation (NOC) from IRAS if they are required to make MediSave contributions, after IRAS has issued a Notice of Assessment for the relevant Year of Assessment.\n",

Am I considered a self-employed person, and do I have to contribute to my CPF?\nThe context is Question 0: Why does CPF Board take self-employed persons to court for not contributing to their MediSave?\nAnswer 0: Self-employed persons (SEPs) are required under the CPF Act to contribute to their MediSave. This ensures that SEPs have enough MediSave savings for their healthcare needs, especially during old age when they have stopped working. SEPs without enough MediSave savings and MediShield Life cover may need to tap on other sources of funds such as their family members’ MediSave savings should they be hospitalised.The CPF Board will continue to be flexible towards those with genuine financial difficulties. SEPs can requestinstalment plansto settle the outstanding amounts over a reasonable period. The CPF Board will only take recalcitrant defaulters to court as the last resort.\nQuestion 1: I am a self-employed person. Can I contribute to my MediSave together with my employees' CPF using the CPF Payment Form (CPF 91)?\nAnswer 1: You’re required to make your MediSave payable separately from your employees' CPF. This is because payments made using the CPF Payment Form (CPF 91) will be credited as employer contributions and will not be recognized as self-employed payments.If you would like to make CPF contributions as a self-employed person, there arevarious waysto do so.\nQuestion 2: I am registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) as a partner for my business. Am I considered a self-employed person or an employee of the partnership?\nAnswer 2: For more information on Partnerships, please visit theInland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) website.\nQuestion 3: Are CPF contributions payable by the holding company or the subsidiary company if I am seconded from the former to latter?\nAnswer 3: The employer who had entered into an employment contract with you is required to pay the CPF contributions.\nQuestion 4: As a taxi driver who takes both ride-hail and street-hail jobs, how should I make CPF contributions for my earnings?\nAnswer 4: You will need to make CPF contributions on ride-hail and street-hail earnings separately.For ride-hail earnings, platform operators will deduct and make CPF contributions for you.For street-hail earnings, you will need to contribute MediSave on your own in the following year after you have declared your net trade income to IRAS.

When will I receive my Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) for the work year?\nAnswer 0: You will receive monthly Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) payments based on your employee and/or platform worker income if you meet the WIS eligibility criteria for the work year (WY).If you have concurrently worked as a self-employed person (SEP) in the year, you may receive additional WIS if your total income (including net trade income) results in a higher WIS payment.

At an hourly wage of $10.501, workers who work 3-hr daily shifts for 16 days a month would already earn more than $500 per month.We recognise that some want to work more but are unable to do so due to their personal circumstances or are in greater need of support, such as Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), ComCare Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance recipients and caregivers of care recipients2.

PCTS will fully offset the increase in platform workers’ CPF contributions in 2025 and gradually taper down before ceasing in 2029.When the platform workers’ CPF contribution rates are fully aligned with employees in 2029, Workfare Income Supplement will be aligned with that of employees for platform workers who are mandated or opt in to the increased CPF contributions.\n",

Do I still need to provide my bank account details?\nAnswer 0: No further action is required from you if you have already registered for PayNow-NRIC with the participating banks. You are encouraged to register for PayNow-NRIC with a PayNow-GIRO-participating local or foreign bank in Singapore to receive your Platform Workers CPF Transition Support (PCTS) payments promptly.

Why is my CPF account balance(s) not updated immediately?\nAnswer 1: Such cases are extremely rare and may arise due to intermittent network connectivity issues beyond CPF Board's control. As a result, the status of your PayNow payment may be delayed, and your CPF account balance(s) may not be updated instantly. Please do not worry as your CPF account balance(s) will be updated within 3-5 working days and you will receive an email notification if you have registered your email address with us. Please check your CPF account balance(s)/E-form status again after 3-5 working days and alert us immediately if your payment is still not updated.\nQuestion 2: What happens if I scan the generated PayNow QR code multiple times?\nAnswer 2: To ensure that your cash top-up is processed smoothly, please only scan the PayNow QR code and make payment once as the code is only valid for a single payment. For subsequent or duplicate payments made using the same QR code, the payment will be refunded.If you need to make another top-up, you will need to submit a new application and obtain a new PayNow QR code.\nQuestion 3: I lost my letter containing the Payment Reference Number (PRN), can someone else take my money?\nAnswer 3: It is not possible to withdraw the money with just the Payment Reference Number as GovCash uses the Singpass Face Verification technology to authenticate users during the withdrawal of the Government benefits from OCBC ATMs. The Face Verification technology incorporates a liveness-detection capability that blocks the use of photographs, videos or masks during the verification process.This security feature prevents any fraudulent withdrawal of the Government benefits by third party using photographs or videos belonging to the beneficiary and ensuring only the eligible Singaporean can perform the withdrawal of his or her Government benefits.\nQuestion 4: Can I cancel the payment after I have confirmed the payment utilising my GovCash on the LifeSG mobile app?\nAnswer 4: No, your GovCash balance will be deducted upon successful payment.\n",

When will the payments attract CPF contribution?\nAnswer 1: Platform earnings and incentives attract CPF contribution when they are due and payable, not when they are accrued.For example, the CPF contributions on an incentive payment in June that is for trips done in May will be computed together with the rest of the June earnings.\nQuestion 2: Why am I not able to reverse my decision after I have opted in to increase my CPF contributions as a platform worker?\nAnswer 2: Opting in is a concession given to help you increase your CPF contributions. By doing so, you will receive higher overall income, considering the contributions from platform operators. Staying committed to the CPF contributions will also ensure that your CPF savings will accumulate interest over time, thereby building up your housing and retirement adequacy in the long run.Allowing opt-outs will not help build up your housing and retirement adequacy in the long run. It is also not practical for platform operators to track the status of workers and apply the different rates of CPF contributions if workers opt in and out multiple times. This may incur additional business costs for platform operators and make implementation more complicated overall.As there is no deadline to opt in, you can carefully consider your decision based on your personal circumstances, before opting in to increase your CPF contributions.\nQuestion 3: Can I apply for refund on CPF contributions paid above the CPF annual ceiling of $102,000?\nAnswer 3: If your total net earnings under a single platform operator exceed $102,000, your platform operator will apply for a refund on the excess CPF contributions from CPF Board. After receiving the refund, your platform operator will refund your share of excess CPF contributions to you.If your total earnings acrossmultipleplatform operators exceed $102,000, you can apply for a refund on your share of the contributions.\nQuestion 4: Why is the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) for platform workers aligned to that of employees only in 2029 when the increased CPF contributions for platform workers is implemented in 2025?\nAnswer 4: CPF contributions rates will gradually increase for platform workers from 2025 to 2028. To support lower-income platform workers during this period, we will provide the Platform Workers CPF Transition Support (PCTS) to help mitigate the drop in take-home earnings. PCTS will fully offset the increase in platform workers’ CPF contributions in 2025 and gradually taper down before ceasing in 2029.When the platform workers’ CPF contribution rates are fully aligned with employees in 2029, Workfare Income Supplement will be aligned with that of employees for platform workers who are mandated or opt in to the increased CPF contributions.\n",

Your platform operators will also not have to incur additional operating costs to re-compute the CPF contribution based on actual expenses.FEDA is applied to all platform workers to simplify the computation of CPF contribution for both platform operators and platform workers, regardless of income levels and delivery modes.

With the lifting of the age cap of 70 from 2025, will my eligibility be revised for the past few years?\nAnswer 0: No, the enhancements start from 2025. With the lifting of the age cap, eligible seniors above 70 can make cash top-ups and receive the same amount of Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (MRSS) matching grant as those aged 55 to 70.

In this way, members will not be worse off than leaving their monies in the CPF Accounts.\nQuestion 1: How will the restriction on investments for the first $20,000 in Ordinary Account and the first $40,000 in Special Account affect me?\nAnswer 1: The first $60,000 of your combined CPF accounts earns an extra 1% interest. To enable members to earn extra interest, only monies in excess of $20,000 in your Ordinary Account (OA) and $40,000 in your Special Account (SA) can be invested.However, you can continue to service your agent bank fees and regular premium insurance policies (excludes recurring single premium insurance policies or regular savings plans for unit trusts) even if your OA balance falls below $20,000.If you have already made investments using your OA or SA balances, you are not required to sell these investments.\nQuestion 2: Why is there a combined tax relief cap for top-ups to the Special Account/Retirement Account and MediSave Account from 1 January 2022?\nAnswer 2: Thecombined tax relieffor cash top-ups to the Special/Retirement Account and MediSave Account (MA) was introduced for greater consistency across CPF schemes. This allows members to better understand and take action to benefit from these schemes.The tax relief eligibility conditions for cash top-ups made before 1 January 2022 had differed1for top-ups to retirement savings and top-ups to MA. With this change2, the tax relief eligibility conditions for cash top-ups made on or after 1 January 2022 across both schemes have been aligned.1Before 1 January 2022, the tax relief eligibility conditions for cash top-ups differed between both scheme in terms of (i) tax beneficiary [giver for Retirement Sum Topping-Up (RSTU); recipient for Voluntary Contribution to MediSave Account (VCMA)]; and (ii) tax relief cap for top-ups to self/loved ones (capped at $7k/$7k for RSTU, tax relief cap for VCMA depended on both the Basic Healthcare Sum and the amount of mandatory CPF contributions for the year).2The changes related to cash top-ups to MA do not apply to MA contributions made as a self-employed person (SEP). If you would like to make MA contributions as a SEP, visit theSelf-Employed Scheme pagefor more information on topping up your MA.\nQuestion 3: Why are CPF transfers not eligible for the matching grant under Matched Retirement Savings Scheme?\nAnswer 3: The Matched Retirement Savings Scheme is designed to encourage cash top-ups to senior Singapore Citizens with lower retirement savings to help them save more. Thus, only cash top-ups to eligible members will be matched.Members making CPF transfers can still benefit from the higher interest rate in the Retirement Account.\nQuestion 4: Can I continue to use my Ordinary Account savings to service my regular premium insurance bought before 1 January 2001, even if my balance falls below $20,000?\nAnswer 4: You can continue to service the future premiums using your Ordinary Account savings, even if your balance falls below $20,000. This applies to you even after age 55 as long as you have set aside the Full Retirement Sum or the Basic Retirement Sum with sufficient property charge/pledge in the Retirement Account.\n",

This allows members to better understand and take action to benefit from these schemes.The tax relief eligibility conditions for cash top-ups made before 1 January 2022 had differed1for top-ups to retirement savings and top-ups to MA. With this change2, the tax relief eligibility conditions for cash top-ups made on or after 1 January 2022 across both schemes have been aligned.1Before 1 January 2022, the tax relief eligibility conditions for cash top-ups differed between both scheme in terms of (i) tax beneficiary [giver for Retirement Sum Topping-Up (RSTU); recipient for Voluntary Contribution to MediSave Account (VCMA)]; and (ii) tax relief cap for top-ups to self/loved ones (capped at $7k/$7k for RSTU, tax relief cap for VCMA depended on both the Basic Healthcare Sum and the amount of mandatory CPF contributions for the year).2The changes related to cash top-ups to MA do not apply to MA contributions made as a self-employed person (SEP).
