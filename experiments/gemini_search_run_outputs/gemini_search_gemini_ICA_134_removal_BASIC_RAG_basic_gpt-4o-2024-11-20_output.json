        "content": "\n   You are a helpful assistant tasked with classifying the quality of answers provided to user questions. You will be given a user's question, a \"Model Answer,\" and an \"Expected Answer.\" Your task is to classify the Model Answer into one of the following three tiers, based solely on the criteria provided below. Do not use any external knowledge or assumptions. Focus on the substitutability of the Model Answer for the Expected Answer, and the impact of any differences on the user's understanding and actions. Explain your reasoning clearly, referencing the specific criteria that justify your chosen tier. Be precise and consider the potential for misinterpretation.\n\n   Classification Tiers:\n\n   Tier 1: Functionally Equivalent (Substitutable with No Negative Impact):\n\n   Definition: The Model Answer conveys the same essential information as the Expected Answer, leading to the same practical user understanding and action. Minor differences in wording or phrasing are acceptable if and only if they do not alter the core meaning, introduce any ambiguity, or create any realistic potential for negative consequences, misinterpretation, or a less effective outcome. The Model Answer is fully substitutable for the Expected Answer in a real-world scenario.\n\n   Key Criteria:\n\n   Information: Core meaning and necessary scope are identical. Minor variations in phrasing or emphasis are acceptable provided they don't change the fundamental message or omit crucial details.\n\n   User Action: The practical user action prompted by the Model Answer is identical to that prompted by the Expected Answer. The user would do the same thing, in the same way, based on either answer.\n\n   Outcome: The outcome is identical.\n\n   Risk: None. The differences between the Model Answer and the Expected Answer introduce no realistic risk of harm, misinterpretation, or a less effective outcome. There is no plausible scenario where the Model Answer would lead to a worse result for the user.\n\n   Tier 2: Substitutable (Minor, Non-Critical Deviations):\n\n   Definition: The Model Answer may omit non-essential information or have minor imprecisions, but the core meaning, primary user action, and overall outcome remain substantially the same. Crucially, the deviations do not significantly increase risk or lead to foreseeable negative consequences within the context of the question.\n\n   Key Criteria:\n\n   Information: Core information is complete and accurate. Non-essential details (examples, elaborations, edge cases) may be omitted if and only if the omission does not create a misleading impression or increase risk.\n\n   User Action: Essentially the same; any differences are minor and don't significantly affect the overall goal or introduce risk.\n\n   Outcome: Substantially the same; no significant negative impact is likely.\n\n   Risk: Very Low. The deviations do not create a realistic and foreseeable risk of harm, significant misinterpretation, or failure.\n\n   Tier 3: Unacceptable (Significant Deviations or Risk):\n\n   Definition: The Model Answer contains significant deviations from the Expected Answer that could negatively impact the user. This includes any of the following:\n\n   Key Criteria:\n   * Omission of the Clearly Optimal Solution: The Model Answer fails to provide the clearly superior solution (primary, officially recommended, best practice) when a readily available and significantly better alternative exists, and this omission creates a substantial disadvantage, increased risk, or a demonstrably worse outcome for the user.\n   * Missing Immediately Critical Information: The Model Answer omits information that is immediately essential for the user to:\n\n   Safely, correctly, or effectively achieve the immediate goal implied by the question.\n\n   Avoid imminent harm, make immediately necessary decisions, or follow required procedures.\n\n   Understand the core principles directly relevant to the specific situation presented in the question.\n\n   *   **Factual Inaccuracies:** The Model Answer contains incorrect information that could realistically mislead the user or lead to tangible negative consequences.\n\n   *  **Dangerous Oversimplification:** The Model Answer oversimplifies complex information to the point where it becomes misleading, inaccurate, or creates a false sense of ease or safety.\n   * **Suboptimal Path without Justification (Significant Detriment):** The answer suggests a path or choice that is demonstrably more difficult, costly, or generally worse for the user, without any offsetting advantages, leading to a significant detriment.\n\n   *   **Risk:** Moderate to high risk of significant negative consequences.\n\n   Classification Guidelines:\n\n   STEP 1: IMMEDIATE tier_3 CHECK\n   Model Answer must be classified as tier_3 if ANY of these exist:\n\n   Critical Information Missing:\n   - Safety or security warnings/precautions\n   - Directs the user to the wrong agency / gives wrong information compared to the expected answer\n   - Risk information that could affect decisions\n   - Hard deadlines or mandatory timing requirements\n   - Required eligibility criteria or conditions\n   - Required process steps without which task cannot be completed\n   - Mandatory alternative methods (when no other method given exists)\n   - Specific numerical criteria that affect eligibility/outcomes\n   - Consequences or outcomes that could cause harm if unknown\n\n   OR:\n   - ANY factually incorrect information\n   - Making specific claims vaguer in ways that affect outcomes\n   - Missing information that would significantly change user decisions/actions\n\n   STEP 2: tier_1 CHECK\n   Only if no tier_3 conditions exist, must have ALL:\n   - Identical critical information\n   - Creates identical understanding and actions\n   - Zero risk of misinterpretation\n   - No meaningful omissions\n\n   STEP 3: tier_2\n   For answers that:\n   - Omit only truly non-critical information like:\n     * Background context\n     * Optional examples\n     * Additional helpful but non-required details\n     * Alternative methods when main method is complete\n   - Have different phrasing but same critical content\n   - Add helpful information without changing core meaning\n   - Miss only \"nice to have\" elements that don't affect outcomes\n\n   When in doubt between tier_2 and tier_3, evaluate if missing information would materially affect user outcomes. Only mark tier_3 if yes.\n   "

You may enrol in any full-time, non-religious course within the duration of your existing pass.If you hold a valid LTVP or DP and wish to study in an approved religious school/madrasah, you will still need to obtain a Student’s Pass. Holders of a valid IEO are exempted from this requirement.\nQuestion 1: Will a Student's Pass Holder be issued a Long-Term Pass automatically upon course completion?\nAnswer 1: Upon course completion, students will have to cancel their Student's Pass (STP) and surrender any physical STP card that was issued to them for cancellation to ICA. Upon cancellation of their STP, they may be granted a short-term visit pass to stay in Singapore (up to 89 days).If you are studying in an Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) and wish to have a longer period of stay to look for jobs upon completion of your course, you may apply for a one-year (non-renewable) long term visit pass (LTVP).You may refer to LTVP for Graduate from IHL Seeking Employment in Singapore for more details.\nQuestion 2: Can Long-Term Pass Holders still travel with a passport which is expiring in 6 months' time or less?\nAnswer 2: Generally, as long as long-term passes (i.e. Student's Pass, Long Term Visit Pass, Work Permit, Employment Pass and Dependant’s Pass, etc.) are valid, the pass holders are able to use their current valid passport upon seeking arrival and departure immigration clearance at the Singapore checkpoints.However, they are advised to be mindful of the immigration requirements of any country they wish to depart, visit or place of return when travelling on a passport that is less than six months valid before embarking on their journey. Where applicable, they should also check with the airline to ensure that they are allowed to board the plane as airlines have the prerogative to issue boarding passes to their passengers.As Singapore’s border measures and entry requirements will evolve as the global situation changes, please visit the MOH website and ICA website for the latest updates on travel and health control measures.It is important for a long-term pass holder to renew his/her foreign passport if it is expiring.

Foreign visitors may also check their email spam/junk folder if they are unable to find the e-Pass in their email inbox.You may refer to ICA website for more information on entering Singapore.\nQuestion 1: Do I need a visa if I want to transit in Singapore?\nAnswer 1: If you arrived at Singapore Changi Airport and were issued with the onward boarding passes for connecting flights out of Changi Airport, you may remain within the Changi Airport transit area until time for flight departure.You can also remain in the transit area if you can obtain the onward boarding passes from any of the Transfer Lounges within the transit area.However, if you are not issued with the onward boarding passes for connecting flights out of Changi Airport; or unable to obtain the onward boarding passes from any of the Transfer Lounges within the transit area, you are advised to exit the transit area as soon as possible.We wish to highlight that most passengers who are arriving on a Low Cost Carrier (LCC) or connecting to a LCC are required to seek immigration clearance and obtain your onward boarding passes in the respective Departure Check-in Hall.If you are required to seek immigration clearance before obtaining your onward boarding passes at the Departure Check-in Hall, you will have to satisfy the prevailing entry requirements, which include possessing an entry visa, where applicable.All passengers are strongly advised to liaise with the relevant airlines before embarking on your journey. For more information on flights connection and transit facilities/ services, please visit the Changi Airport Group's website.\nQuestion 2: What is the difference between visa and visit pass?\nAnswer 2: A valid Singapore visa is not an immigration pass. A valid entry visa is a pre-entry requirement that you must apply for before travelling to seek entry into Singapore if you hold a travel document issued by one of the following countries/places listed on ICA website.Possessing a valid visa does not guarantee entry into Singapore. You will have to satisfy the basic entry requirements (https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart/entering-singapore) before being considered for entry into Singapore.The grant of a visit pass is determined by the ICA officers at the point of entry. The period of stay granted is shown on the visit pass endorsement given on the passport or the electronic Visit Pass (e-Pass) issued to you through email. You can visit the e-Pass portal or use the Visit Pass Validity Tool to check the expiry of your e-Pass or visit pass. Please note that the period of stay is not tied to the validity of your entry visa.You may refer to ICA website for more information should you require to extend your visit pass.\nQuestion 3: Do I have to retrieve or download and print the approved e-Visa to travel to Singapore?\nAnswer 3: You are strongly encouraged to print and bring along your e-Visa to avoid any inconvenience as the airlines and immigration authorities of your country of embarkation are likely to ask for the e-Visa for verification.You can retrieve your valid e-Visa via the 'Enquire Application Status' function at the ICA e-Service with the visa application reference number and applicant's travel document number.\nQuestion 4: Why is it necessary for all arriving travellers to submit SG Arrival Card with health declaration?\nAnswer 4: The electronic health declaration is in place for purposes of disease control, specifically to guard against importing diseases of concern, to protect the health of Singapore residents. Those who make false declarations may be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act.\n",

Please refer to ICA website for more information regarding the extension of an STVP.\nQuestion 2: What is the difference between visa and visit pass?\nAnswer 2: A valid Singapore visa is not an immigration pass. A valid entry visa is a pre-entry requirement that you must apply for before travelling to seek entry into Singapore if you hold a travel document issued by one of the following countries/places listed on ICA website.Possessing a valid visa does not guarantee entry into Singapore. You will have to satisfy the basic entry requirements (https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart/entering-singapore) before being considered for entry into Singapore.The grant of a visit pass is determined by the ICA officers at the point of entry. The period of stay granted is shown on the visit pass endorsement given on the passport or the electronic Visit Pass (e-Pass) issued to you through email. You can visit the e-Pass portal or use the Visit Pass Validity Tool to check the expiry of your e-Pass or visit pass. Please note that the period of stay is not tied to the validity of your entry visa.You may refer to ICA website for more information should you require to extend your visit pass.\nQuestion 3: Can Long-Term Pass Holders still travel with a passport which is expiring in 6 months' time or less?\nAnswer 3: Generally, as long as long-term passes (i.e. Student's Pass, Long Term Visit Pass, Work Permit, Employment Pass and Dependant’s Pass, etc.) are valid, the pass holders are able to use their current valid passport upon seeking arrival and departure immigration clearance at the Singapore checkpoints.However, they are advised to be mindful of the immigration requirements of any country they wish to depart, visit or place of return when travelling on a passport that is less than six months valid before embarking on their journey. Where applicable, they should also check with the airline to ensure that they are allowed to board the plane as airlines have the prerogative to issue boarding passes to their passengers.As Singapore’s border measures and entry requirements will evolve as the global situation changes, please visit the MOH website and ICA website for the latest updates on travel and health control measures.It is important for a long-term pass holder to renew his/her foreign passport if it is expiring. Ensuring that a passport remains valid will allow ICA to determine his/her foreign citizenship.For all matters relating to foreign passport, please approach the respective Embassy/Consulate/Overseas Mission in Singapore.Once a new passport is obtained, a long-term pass holder will need to update his/her new passport details with the relevant issuing authority accordingly.ICA-issued Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders are required to update his/her new passport details with ICA accordingly once he/she has been issued with a new passport.\nQuestion 4: Why is there no arrival endorsement in my passport after I enter Singapore as a foreign visitor?\nAnswer 4: ICA has replaced the arrival stamp endorsements issued to foreign visitors on short-term visit pass with the electronic Visit Pass (e-Pass).Upon granted entry into Singapore, the e-Pass will be automatically issued to foreign visitors via email based on the email address declared in their SG Arrival Card submission.

A valid entry visa is a pre-entry requirement that you must apply for before travelling to seek entry into Singapore if you hold a travel document issued by one of the following countries/places listed on ICA website.Possessing a valid visa does not guarantee entry into Singapore. You will have to satisfy the basic entry requirements (https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart/entering-singapore) before being considered for entry into Singapore.The grant of a visit pass is determined by the ICA officers at the point of entry. The period of stay granted is shown on the visit pass endorsement given on the passport or the electronic Visit Pass (e-Pass) issued to you through email. You can visit the e-Pass portal or use the Visit Pass Validity Tool to check the expiry of your e-Pass or visit pass. Please note that the period of stay is not tied to the validity of your entry visa.You may refer to ICA website for more information should you require to extend your visit pass.\nQuestion 4: Can Long-Term Pass Holders still travel with a passport which is expiring in 6 months' time or less?\nAnswer 4: Generally, as long as long-term passes (i.e. Student's Pass, Long Term Visit Pass, Work Permit, Employment Pass and Dependant’s Pass, etc.) are valid, the pass holders are able to use their current valid passport upon seeking arrival and departure immigration clearance at the Singapore checkpoints.However, they are advised to be mindful of the immigration requirements of any country they wish to depart, visit or place of return when travelling on a passport that is less than six months valid before embarking on their journey. Where applicable, they should also check with the airline to ensure that they are allowed to board the plane as airlines have the prerogative to issue boarding passes to their passengers.As Singapore’s border measures and entry requirements will evolve as the global situation changes, please visit the MOH website and ICA website for the latest updates on travel and health control measures.It is important for a long-term pass holder to renew his/her foreign passport if it is expiring. Ensuring that a passport remains valid will allow ICA to determine his/her foreign citizenship.For all matters relating to foreign passport, please approach the respective Embassy/Consulate/Overseas Mission in Singapore.Once a new passport is obtained, a long-term pass holder will need to update his/her new passport details with the relevant issuing authority accordingly.ICA-issued Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders are required to update his/her new passport details with ICA accordingly once he/she has been issued with a new passport.\n",

In this case, to ensure a seamless and smooth travel experience, the traveller should use a group QR code that contains his/her three other travelling companions' profiles if only four (and not five) people are travelling.Tip: Traveller can create a group QR code that has five profiles and another separate QR code that contains four profiles. Different QR codes can be named uniquely (e.g., Family, Friends, and Colleagues).\nQuestion 1: Can travellers update the members in the group QR code for different trips?\nAnswer 1: The MyICA mobile app can store multiple group QR codes with different group members.

Travellers have the option to customise group names (e.g., 'Family', or 'Friends') to better fit their travel requirements.\nQuestion 2: What will happen if a traveller or his/her travel companion submits wrong passport information while generating the QR code?\nAnswer 2: It is crucial for travellers to verify and confirm the accuracy of the details included in the QR code.

Hence, no further actions are required for these group of travellers.The QR code will be invalid for use once the passport has expired. MyICA mobile app will prompt users that their passport has expired or is expiring (i.e., passport with less than six months' validity).After travellers have received a new passport, they can update their or others' profile information in MyICA mobile app. This includes making changes to details such as the new passport number and passport expiry date.\nQuestion 4: What happens if travellers do not have mobile data to access the QR Code in MyICA mobile app?\nAnswer 4: The QR code generation works in offline mode.Travellers can still create and retrieve the QR code for self-scanning at the immigration counters, even if travellers do not have mobile data.For a smooth journey, travellers are advised to generate their individual or group QR code before their arrival at Singapore land checkpoints.\n",

There is no need to cancel the STVP if a traveller wishes to depart Singapore before the expiry.\nQuestion 1: Can Long-Term Pass Holders still travel with a passport which is expiring in 6 months' time or less?\nAnswer 1: Generally, as long as long-term passes (i.e. Student's Pass, Long Term Visit Pass, Work Permit, Employment Pass and Dependant’s Pass, etc.) are valid, the pass holders are able to use their current valid passport upon seeking arrival and departure immigration clearance at the Singapore checkpoints.However, they are advised to be mindful of the immigration requirements of any country they wish to depart, visit or place of return when travelling on a passport that is less than six months valid before embarking on their journey. Where applicable, they should also check with the airline to ensure that they are allowed to board the plane as airlines have the prerogative to issue boarding passes to their passengers.As Singapore’s border measures and entry requirements will evolve as the global situation changes, please visit the MOH website and ICA website for the latest updates on travel and health control measures.It is important for a long-term pass holder to renew his/her foreign passport if it is expiring. Ensuring that a passport remains valid will allow ICA to determine his/her foreign citizenship.For all matters relating to foreign passport, please approach the respective Embassy/Consulate/Overseas Mission in Singapore.Once a new passport is obtained, a long-term pass holder will need to update his/her new passport details with the relevant issuing authority accordingly.ICA-issued Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders are required to update his/her new passport details with ICA accordingly once he/she has been issued with a new passport.\nQuestion 2: Can Dependant's Pass (DP) holders study in Singapore?\nAnswer 2: If you hold a valid Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP), Dependant's Pass (DP) or Immigration Exemption Order (IEO), you are not required to obtain a Student's Pass to pursue full-time, non-religious related studies in Singapore. You may enrol in any full-time, non-religious course within the duration of your existing pass.If you hold a valid LTVP or DP and wish to study in an approved religious school/madrasah, you will still need to obtain a Student’s Pass. Holders of a valid IEO are exempted from this requirement.\nQuestion 3: How do I extend my Short-Term Visit Pass (STVP) or stay in Singapore?\nAnswer 3: All short-term visit pass (STVP) extension applications must be submitted online via the e-Service.

You will have to satisfy the basic entry requirements (https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart/entering-singapore) before being considered for entry into Singapore.The grant of a visit pass is determined by the ICA officers at the point of entry. The period of stay granted is shown on the visit pass endorsement given on the passport or the electronic Visit Pass (e-Pass) issued to you through email. You can visit the e-Pass portal or use the Visit Pass Validity Tool to check the expiry of your e-Pass or visit pass. Please note that the period of stay is not tied to the validity of your entry visa.You may refer to ICA website for more information should you require to extend your visit pass.\nQuestion 1: What is Visa Free Transit Facility (VFTF) and who is eligible for VFTF?\nAnswer 1: The 96-hour Visa Free Transit Facility (VFTF) may be available to nationals of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)[1], Georgia, India, Turkmenistan and Ukraine; as well as selected[2] Nationals of the People's Republic of China (PRC) who are not holding ordinary, diplomatic, public affairs or service PRC passports.Transit travellers who satisfy the criteria for VFTF will have to meet the prevailing entry requirements before they are allowed entry into Singapore. Assessment for entry is determined by the ICA officers at the point of entry. Extension of stay for transit travellers under VFTF is strictly not allowed.Please refer to ICA websites for more information on the following:Visa Free Transit FacilityCheck if You Need an Entry Visa[1] CIS refers to: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan.[2] These include holder of the PRC Travel Document, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Document of Identity (DOI) and Macau SAR Travel Permit. Holder of ordinary, diplomatic, public affairs and service PRC passports are excluded.\nQuestion 2: Do the People’s Republic of China (PRC) nationals need to apply for an entry visa if they intend to stay for more than 30 days?\nAnswer 2: With effect from 9 February 2024, holders of ordinary passports issued by the People’s Republic of China will be exempted from visa requirements for a stay of up to 30 days in Singapore. Holders of PRC ordinary passports are not required to apply for an entry visa before entry into Singapore.If they wish to stay beyond 30 days, they may submit an online application to ICA to extend their short-term visit pass (STVP), after entering Singapore. The application can only be submitted up to 14 days before the STVP expires.Applications for STVP extension are subject to approval and relevant fees may apply. Please refer to ICA website for more information regarding the extension of an STVP.\nQuestion 3: Why is there no arrival endorsement in my passport after I enter Singapore as a foreign visitor?\nAnswer 3: ICA has replaced the arrival stamp endorsements issued to foreign visitors on short-term visit pass with the electronic Visit Pass (e-Pass).Upon granted entry into Singapore, the e-Pass will be automatically issued to foreign visitors via email based on the email address declared in their SG Arrival Card submission. Foreign visitors may also check their email spam/junk folder if they are unable to find the e-Pass in their email inbox.You may refer to ICA website for more information on entering Singapore.\nQuestion 4: Do I have to retrieve or download and print the approved e-Visa to travel to Singapore?\nAnswer 4: You are strongly encouraged to print and bring along your e-Visa to avoid any inconvenience as the airlines and immigration authorities of your country of embarkation are likely to ask for the e-Visa for verification.You can retrieve your valid e-Visa via the 'Enquire Application Status' function at the ICA e-Service with the visa application reference number and applicant's travel document number.\n",

However, a valid Re-Entry Permit (REP) is needed each time a Singapore PR travels abroad. The REP allows you to retain your Singapore PR status while you are outside of Singapore.

Can I request for a longer duration of Re-Entry Permit (REP)?\nAnswer 4: All REP renewal applications are being carefully assessed, taking into consideration all relevant factors, before a decision is made. If there are fresh facts and circumstances to support your request for a longer REP validity, you may furnish them to us for consideration at your next REP renewal.\n",

Hence, no further actions are required for these group of travellers.The QR code will be invalid for use once the passport has expired. MyICA mobile app will prompt users that their passport has expired or is expiring (i.e., passport with less than six months' validity).After travellers have received a new passport, they can update their or others' profile information in MyICA mobile app. This includes making changes to details such as the new passport number and passport expiry date.\nQuestion 2: What happens if travellers do not have mobile data to access the QR Code in MyICA mobile app?\nAnswer 2: The QR code generation works in offline mode.Travellers can still create and retrieve the QR code for self-scanning at the immigration counters, even if travellers do not have mobile data.For a smooth journey, travellers are advised to generate their individual or group QR code before their arrival at Singapore land checkpoints.\nQuestion 3: If a traveller plans to visit Malaysia with three companions but has initially generated a group QR code for a total of five people, what should he/she do when only four people are going for the trip?\nAnswer 3: It is important that those travelling in a group use a group QR code containing the passport details of those travelling in the same vehicle. In this case, to ensure a seamless and smooth travel experience, the traveller should use a group QR code that contains his/her three other travelling companions' profiles if only four (and not five) people are travelling.Tip: Traveller can create a group QR code that has five profiles and another separate QR code that contains four profiles. Different QR codes can be named uniquely (e.g., Family, Friends, and Colleagues).\nQuestion 4: Why is QR code introduced for immigration clearance?\nAnswer 4: Travellers arriving and departing via Singapore land checkpoints by car, motorcycle, lorry or bus can use QR codes in lieu of passports for faster and more convenient immigration clearance.This means that instead of using their passports at the immigration lanes, they will only need to scan a single QR code which they generate prior to arriving at the checkpoint.\n",

Where applicable, they should also check with the airline to ensure that they are allowed to board the plane as airlines have the prerogative to issue boarding passes to their passengers.As Singapore’s border measures and entry requirements will evolve as the global situation changes, please visit the MOH website and ICA website for the latest updates on travel and health control measures.It is important for a long-term pass holder to renew his/her foreign passport if it is expiring.

This will delay their immigration clearance unnecessarily.\nQuestion 1: What is SGAC or SG Arrival Card?\nAnswer 1: SG Arrival Card,  also known as SGAC is the electronic version of the paper Disembarkation/Embarkation (D/E) card that every foreign visitor must present for immigration clearance. A D/E number is provided to foreign visitors after SGAC submission.The submission of the SG Arrival Card is one of the basic entry requirements to visit Singapore. The use of the SG Arrival Card e-Service is free of charge. Please also note that the SG Arrival Card is not a visa.\nQuestion 2: I have submitted my SG Arrival Card (SGAC) with health declaration?

You would need to use your Singpass to access the ICA e-Service and transfer the remaining validity of your valid REP from the old to the new passport. Otherwise, you may be inconvenienced each time you travel in and out of Singapore.\nQuestion 1: What is required to maintain Permanent Residence (PR) status?\nAnswer 1: A Singapore permanent resident (SPR) who wishes to leave Singapore must obtain a Re-Entry Permit (REP) to enable him/her to return to Singapore as a SPR.  A SPR who remains outside Singapore without a valid REP will lose his/her PR status.\nQuestion 2: Does the Singapore Permanent Residence (PR) status expires?\nAnswer 2: The Singapore PR status will not expire. However, a valid Re-Entry Permit (REP) is needed each time a Singapore PR travels abroad. The REP allows you to retain your Singapore PR status while you are outside of Singapore. If you leave Singapore or remain overseas without a valid REP, you will lose your Singapore PR status. You must login to ICA e-Service using your Singpass to renew your REP.\nQuestion 3: How do I apply for Singapore Permanent Residence (PR) and what are the eligibility criteria for PR application?\nAnswer 3: You may refer to the ICA website for more information on the eligibility criteria for PR application.\nQuestion 4: How do I check the status of my Singapore citizenship, Permanent Residence and/or Long-Term Visit Pass application if I do not have SingPass?\nAnswer 4: If you have submitted your application on or after 26 June 2024, you may log in to the ICA e-Service with your reference number to check the status of your Singapore Citizenship, Permanent Residence or Long-Term Visit Pass application.You will be redirected to the Case Summary page where you can check your status enquiry.\n",

However, a valid Re-Entry Permit (REP) is needed each time a Singapore PR travels abroad. The REP allows you to retain your Singapore PR status while you are outside of Singapore. If you leave Singapore or remain overseas without a valid REP, you will lose your Singapore PR status. You must login to ICA e-Service using your Singpass to renew your REP.\nQuestion 1: Can I enter as a PR if my Re-Entry Permit is tagged to my old passport instead of my new passport?\nAnswer 1: You may enter as a Singapore Permanent Resident (PR) if your Re-Entry Permit (REP) is still valid. You would need to use your Singpass to access the ICA e-Service and transfer the remaining validity of your valid REP from the old to the new passport. Otherwise, you may be inconvenienced each time you travel in and out of Singapore.\nQuestion 2: How do I check if a person is a Singapore Permanent Resident (PR)?\nAnswer 2: You may check the validity of the Re-entry Permit (REP) held by the person alongside a valid Identity Card (IC) or Digital IC (if available).\nQuestion 3: How do I get back my Permanent Residence (PR) status if I had previously renounced PR?\nAnswer 3: There is no provision to reinstate the PR status of those who have renounced their status voluntarily. If you are Interested to become a Singapore PR again, you may submit a fresh application to us for consideration if you meet the prevailing application criteria for PR.\nQuestion 4: How can I renew my Re-Entry Permit (REP) if I am residing/working overseas?\nAnswer 4: Applicants with valid Singpass account can submit your applications for REP facilities using ICA e-Service while overseas.If you do not have a Singpass account, you can submit your application through our Singapore Missions overseas. Please note that overseas application must be submitted at least two months before the expiry of the current REP.\n",

Where applicable, they should also check with the airline to ensure that they are allowed to board the plane as airlines have the prerogative to issue boarding passes to their passengers.As Singapore’s border measures and entry requirements will evolve as the global situation changes, please visit the MOH website and ICA website for the latest updates on travel and health control measures.It is important for a long-term pass holder to renew his/her foreign passport if it is expiring. Ensuring that a passport remains valid will allow ICA to determine his/her foreign citizenship.For all matters relating to foreign passport, please approach the respective Embassy/Consulate/Overseas Mission in Singapore.Once a new passport is obtained, a long-term pass holder will need to update his/her new passport details with the relevant issuing authority accordingly.ICA-issued Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders are required to update his/her new passport details with ICA accordingly once he/she has been issued with a new passport.\n",

Where applicable, they should also check with the airline to ensure that they are allowed to board the plane as airlines have the prerogative to issue boarding passes to their passengers.As Singapore’s border measures and entry requirements will evolve as the global situation changes, please visit the MOH website and ICA website for the latest updates on travel and health control measures.It is important for a long-term pass holder to renew his/her foreign passport if it is expiring. Ensuring that a passport remains valid will allow ICA to determine his/her foreign citizenship.For all matters relating to foreign passport, please approach the respective Embassy/Consulate/Overseas Mission in Singapore.Once a new passport is obtained, a long-term pass holder will need to update his/her new passport details with the relevant issuing authority accordingly.ICA-issued Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders are required to update his/her new passport details with ICA accordingly once he/she has been issued with a new passport.",

Where applicable, they should also check with the airline to ensure that they are allowed to board the plane as airlines have the prerogative to issue boarding passes to their passengers.As Singapore’s border measures and entry requirements will evolve as the global situation changes, please visit the MOH website and ICA website for the latest updates on travel and health control measures.It is important for a long-term pass holder to renew his/her foreign passport if it is expiring. Ensuring that a passport remains valid will allow ICA to determine his/her foreign citizenship.For all matters relating to foreign passport, please approach the respective Embassy/Consulate/Overseas Mission in Singapore.Once a new passport is obtained, a long-term pass holder will need to update his/her new passport details with the relevant issuing authority accordingly.ICA-issued Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders are required to update his/her new passport details with ICA accordingly once he/she has been issued with a new passport.",

Minor is required to take the ORAL on or after 21st birthday date and no later than 22nd birthday.Once the minor has completed his/her oath taking formalities, he/she may apply for Singapore passport. Nonetheless, should the minor require to extend the validity of his/her Singapore Passport before taking the Oath, and in need to travel, he/she may apply for a new passport with a validity one day before his/her 22nd birthday. The passport can only be extended to its full 10-year after the minor has taken the ORAL.You may contact us via the enquiry form if you require further clarifications on passport renewal.\nQuestion 1: Does the Singapore Permanent Residence (PR) status expires?\nAnswer 1: The Singapore PR status will not expire. However, a valid Re-Entry Permit (REP) is needed each time a Singapore PR travels abroad. The REP allows you to retain your Singapore PR status while you are outside of Singapore. If you leave Singapore or remain overseas without a valid REP, you will lose your Singapore PR status. You must login to ICA e-Service using your Singpass to renew your REP.\nQuestion 2: What is required to maintain Permanent Residence (PR) status?\nAnswer 2: A Singapore permanent resident (SPR) who wishes to leave Singapore must obtain a Re-Entry Permit (REP) to enable him/her to return to Singapore as a SPR.  A SPR who remains outside Singapore without a valid REP will lose his/her PR status.\nQuestion 3: Can Long-Term Pass Holders still travel with a passport which is expiring in 6 months' time or less?\nAnswer 3: Generally, as long as long-term passes (i.e. Student's Pass, Long Term Visit Pass, Work Permit, Employment Pass and Dependant’s Pass, etc.) are valid, the pass holders are able to use their current valid passport upon seeking arrival and departure immigration clearance at the Singapore checkpoints.However, they are advised to be mindful of the immigration requirements of any country they wish to depart, visit or place of return when travelling on a passport that is less than six months valid before embarking on their journey. Where applicable, they should also check with the airline to ensure that they are allowed to board the plane as airlines have the prerogative to issue boarding passes to their passengers.As Singapore’s border measures and entry requirements will evolve as the global situation changes, please visit the MOH website and ICA website for the latest updates on travel and health control measures.It is important for a long-term pass holder to renew his/her foreign passport if it is expiring. Ensuring that a passport remains valid will allow ICA to determine his/her foreign citizenship.For all matters relating to foreign passport, please approach the respective Embassy/Consulate/Overseas Mission in Singapore.Once a new passport is obtained, a long-term pass holder will need to update his/her new passport details with the relevant issuing authority accordingly.ICA-issued Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders are required to update his/her new passport details with ICA accordingly once he/she has been issued with a new passport.\nQuestion 4: Can I register/replace my IC when I am residing overseas?\nAnswer 4: You need to collect your IC in person. Please only register/replace your IC if you are planning to return to Singapore within the next six months.\n",

                "answer": "Generally, as long as long-term passes (i.e. Student's Pass, Long Term Visit Pass, Work Permit, Employment Pass and Dependant’s Pass, etc.) are valid, the pass holders are able to use their current valid passport upon seeking arrival and departure immigration clearance at the Singapore checkpoints.However, they are advised to be mindful of the immigration requirements of any country they wish to depart, visit or place of return when travelling on a passport that is less than six months valid before embarking on their journey. Where applicable, they should also check with the airline to ensure that they are allowed to board the plane as airlines have the prerogative to issue boarding passes to their passengers.As Singapore’s border measures and entry requirements will evolve as the global situation changes, please visit the MOH website and ICA website for the latest updates on travel and health control measures.It is important for a long-term pass holder to renew his/her foreign passport if it is expiring. Ensuring that a passport remains valid will allow ICA to determine his/her foreign citizenship.For all matters relating to foreign passport, please approach the respective Embassy/Consulate/Overseas Mission in Singapore.Once a new passport is obtained, a long-term pass holder will need to update his/her new passport details with the relevant issuing authority accordingly.ICA-issued Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders are required to update his/her new passport details with ICA accordingly once he/she has been issued with a new passport.",
