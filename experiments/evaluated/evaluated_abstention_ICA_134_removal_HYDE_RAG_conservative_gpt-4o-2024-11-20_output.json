Travellers can edit the members in a group by adding or removing the member profile and regenerating the QR code even in offline mode (i.e., without mobile data). Travellers have the option to customise group names (e.g., 'Family', or 'Friends') to better fit their travel requirements.\nQuestion 1: Is there a limit to the number of profiles in a group QR code?\nAnswer 1: A single group QR code can contain up to 10 profiles.For travellers who selected \"Motorcycle\" as the vehicle type, only a maximum of two profiles are allowed in this group QR code.For travellers who selected \"Lorry\" or “Bus” as the vehicle type, only a maximum of four profiles are allowed in this group QR code.Nevertheless, travellers are free to create and customise multiple groups of QR codes, depending on their travel needs.\nQuestion 2: What will happen if a traveller or his/her travel companion submits wrong passport information while generating the QR code?\nAnswer 2: It is crucial for travellers to verify and confirm the accuracy of the details included in the QR code. Failure to do so may lead to inconvenience when they undergo immigration clearance at Singapore Land checkpoints.If you need to correct any inaccuracies in the information you have provided, you may edit the details through navigating to the 'edit' option under your profile.\nQuestion 3: Are travellers required to bring their passport along when travelling to Malaysia, given that they can now use a QR code for immigration clearance?\nAnswer 3: The QR code can only be used for immigration clearance at Singapore land checkpoints via car, motorcycle, lorry and bus.Travellers are reminded to bring their passports when travelling overseas, as it remains the official travel document for identification during overseas travel.\nQuestion 4: What should the traveller do when his/her QR code is expiring?\nAnswer 4: When the traveller accesses the QR code via the MyICA mobile app and their passports is still valid, the QR code's validity will be automatically extended. Hence, no further actions are required for these group of travellers.The QR code will be invalid for use once the passport has expired. MyICA mobile app will prompt users that their passport has expired or is expiring (i.e., passport with less than six months' validity).After travellers have received a new passport, they can update their or others' profile information in MyICA mobile app. This includes making changes to details such as the new passport number and passport expiry date.\n",

You may enrol in any full-time, non-religious course within the duration of your existing pass.If you hold a valid LTVP or DP and wish to study in an approved religious school/madrasah, you will still need to obtain a Student’s Pass. Holders of a valid IEO are exempted from this requirement.\nQuestion 1: Will a Student's Pass Holder be issued a Long-Term Pass automatically upon course completion?\nAnswer 1: Upon course completion, students will have to cancel their Student's Pass (STP) and surrender any physical STP card that was issued to them for cancellation to ICA. Upon cancellation of their STP, they may be granted a short-term visit pass to stay in Singapore (up to 89 days).If you are studying in an Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) and wish to have a longer period of stay to look for jobs upon completion of your course, you may apply for a one-year (non-renewable) long term visit pass (LTVP).You may refer to LTVP for Graduate from IHL Seeking Employment in Singapore for more details.\nQuestion 2: Why did I get a 3-month extension for my current LTVP?\nAnswer 2: Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) renewal applicants who are eligible for the LTVP extension will receive an email notification to inform you on the 3-month extension for your current LTVP. This is an interim arrangement while we process your LTVP renewal application. We will inform you the outcome of your renewal application via email.\nQuestion 3: Can Long-Term Pass Holders still travel with a passport which is expiring in 6 months' time or less?\nAnswer 3: Generally, as long as long-term passes (i.e. Student's Pass, Long Term Visit Pass, Work Permit, Employment Pass and Dependant’s Pass, etc.) are valid, the pass holders are able to use their current valid passport upon seeking arrival and departure immigration clearance at the Singapore checkpoints.However, they are advised to be mindful of the immigration requirements of any country they wish to depart, visit or place of return when travelling on a passport that is less than six months valid before embarking on their journey. Where applicable, they should also check with the airline to ensure that they are allowed to board the plane as airlines have the prerogative to issue boarding passes to their passengers.As Singapore’s border measures and entry requirements will evolve as the global situation changes, please visit the MOH website and ICA website for the latest updates on travel and health control measures.It is important for a long-term pass holder to renew his/her foreign passport if it is expiring. Ensuring that a passport remains valid will allow ICA to determine his/her foreign citizenship.For all matters relating to foreign passport, please approach the respective Embassy/Consulate/Overseas Mission in Singapore.Once a new passport is obtained, a long-term pass holder will need to update his/her new passport details with the relevant issuing authority accordingly.ICA-issued Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders are required to update his/her new passport details with ICA accordingly once he/she has been issued with a new passport.\nQuestion 4: Can I request for a Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) physical card after 27 Feb 2023?\nAnswer 4: ICA had ceased the issuance of Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) physical cards from 27 Feb 2023. LTVP will henceforth be issued in digital format only.\n",

Meanwhile, Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) is applicable in scenarios such as allowing graduates to stay longer for employment search or for renewal, where it involves processes like extensions and digital issuance without physical cards.

Extension of stay for transit travellers under VFTF is strictly not allowed.Please refer to ICA websites for more information on the following:Visa Free Transit FacilityCheck if You Need an Entry Visa[1] CIS refers to: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan.[2] These include holder of the PRC Travel Document, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Document of Identity (DOI) and Macau SAR Travel Permit.

A SPR who remains outside Singapore without a valid REP will lose his/her PR status.\nQuestion 2: Can Long-Term Pass Holders still travel with a passport which is expiring in 6 months' time or less?\nAnswer 2: Generally, as long as long-term passes (i.e. Student's Pass, Long Term Visit Pass, Work Permit, Employment Pass and Dependant’s Pass, etc.) are valid, the pass holders are able to use their current valid passport upon seeking arrival and departure immigration clearance at the Singapore checkpoints.However, they are advised to be mindful of the immigration requirements of any country they wish to depart, visit or place of return when travelling on a passport that is less than six months valid before embarking on their journey. Where applicable, they should also check with the airline to ensure that they are allowed to board the plane as airlines have the prerogative to issue boarding passes to their passengers.As Singapore’s border measures and entry requirements will evolve as the global situation changes, please visit the MOH website and ICA website for the latest updates on travel and health control measures.It is important for a long-term pass holder to renew his/her foreign passport if it is expiring.

However, a valid Re-Entry Permit (REP) is needed each time a Singapore PR travels abroad. The REP allows you to retain your Singapore PR status while you are outside of Singapore. If you leave Singapore or remain overseas without a valid REP, you will lose your Singapore PR status. You must login to ICA e-Service using your Singpass to renew your REP.\nQuestion 4: How do I extend my Short-Term Visit Pass (STVP) or stay in Singapore?\nAnswer 4: All short-term visit pass (STVP) extension applications must be submitted online via the e-Service. Walk-in applications will not be accepted. You are advised to submit your application when your STVP has a remaining validity of 14 days or less.

A valid entry visa is a pre-entry requirement that you must apply for before travelling to seek entry into Singapore if you hold a travel document issued by one of the following countries/places listed on ICA website.Possessing a valid visa does not guarantee entry into Singapore. You will have to satisfy the basic entry requirements (https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart/entering-singapore) before being considered for entry into Singapore.The grant of a visit pass is determined by the ICA officers at the point of entry. The period of stay granted is shown on the visit pass endorsement given on the passport or the electronic Visit Pass (e-Pass) issued to you through email. You can visit the e-Pass portal or use the Visit Pass Validity Tool to check the expiry of your e-Pass or visit pass. Please note that the period of stay is not tied to the validity of your entry visa.You may refer to ICA website for more information should you require to extend your visit pass.\nQuestion 2: Do the People’s Republic of China (PRC) nationals need to apply for an entry visa if they intend to stay for more than 30 days?\nAnswer 2: With effect from 9 February 2024, holders of ordinary passports issued by the People’s Republic of China will be exempted from visa requirements for a stay of up to 30 days in Singapore. Holders of PRC ordinary passports are not required to apply for an entry visa before entry into Singapore.If they wish to stay beyond 30 days, they may submit an online application to ICA to extend their short-term visit pass (STVP), after entering Singapore. The application can only be submitted up to 14 days before the STVP expires.Applications for STVP extension are subject to approval and relevant fees may apply. Please refer to ICA website for more information regarding the extension of an STVP.\nQuestion 3: How do I know which designated lanes to use on arrival and is it applicable for all checkpoints?\nAnswer 3: There will be signages to inform eligible foreign visitors to use the designated lanes for immigration clearance at the respective passenger halls.These designated lanes are currently available at Tuas Checkpoint, Woodlands Checkpoint and Marina Bay Cruise Centre.Travellers of all nationalities, entering via Changi Airport Arrival Terminals are eligible to seek clearance at the automated lanes.\nQuestion 4: Why is there no arrival endorsement in my passport after I enter Singapore as a foreign visitor?\nAnswer 4: ICA has replaced the arrival stamp endorsements issued to foreign visitors on short-term visit pass with the electronic Visit Pass (e-Pass).Upon granted entry into Singapore, the e-Pass will be automatically issued to foreign visitors via email based on the email address declared in their SG Arrival Card submission.

You will have to satisfy the basic entry requirements (https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart/entering-singapore) before being considered for entry into Singapore.The grant of a visit pass is determined by the ICA officers at the point of entry. The period of stay granted is shown on the visit pass endorsement given on the passport or the electronic Visit Pass (e-Pass) issued to you through email. You can visit the e-Pass portal or use the Visit Pass Validity Tool to check the expiry of your e-Pass or visit pass. Please note that the period of stay is not tied to the validity of your entry visa.You may refer to ICA website for more information should you require to extend your visit pass.\nQuestion 4: What happens if travellers do not have mobile data to access the QR Code in MyICA mobile app?\nAnswer 4: The QR code generation works in offline mode.Travellers can still create and retrieve the QR code for self-scanning at the immigration counters, even if travellers do not have mobile data.For a smooth journey, travellers are advised to generate their individual or group QR code before their arrival at Singapore land checkpoints.\n",

A SPR who remains outside Singapore without a valid REP will lose his/her PR status.\nQuestion 1: Will my PR status be revoked if I divorce my spouse who sponsored my Singapore Permanent Residence (PR) application?\nAnswer 1: Any cancellation of PR must be done in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Act (Chapter 133) or the Regulations thereunder. While your PR may be sponsored by your spouse, your renewal of REP will be assessed on your own merits if you are divorced or under-going divorce.\nQuestion 2: Does the Singapore Permanent Residence (PR) status expires?\nAnswer 2: The Singapore PR status will not expire. However, a valid Re-Entry Permit (REP) is needed each time a Singapore PR travels abroad. The REP allows you to retain your Singapore PR status while you are outside of Singapore. If you leave Singapore or remain overseas without a valid REP, you will lose your Singapore PR status. You must login to ICA e-Service using your Singpass to renew your REP.\nQuestion 3: How can I appeal if my Singapore Permanent Residence (PR) application is rejected or unsuccessful?\nAnswer 3: You may consider submitting a fresh application for permanent residence online if there are changes to your circumstances.\nQuestion 4: Can I enter as a PR if my Re-Entry Permit is tagged to my old passport instead of my new passport?\nAnswer 4: You may enter as a Singapore Permanent Resident (PR) if your Re-Entry Permit (REP) is still valid. You would need to use your Singpass to access the ICA e-Service and transfer the remaining validity of your valid REP from the old to the new passport. Otherwise, you may be inconvenienced each time you travel in and out of Singapore.\n",

Foreign visitors may also check their email spam/junk folder if they are unable to find the e-Pass in their email inbox.Foreign visitors may also retrieve the e-Pass issued to them via the e-Pass Enquiry Portal. The portal is accessible via the SG Arrival Card e-Service or via the direct URL: https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/epassenquiry.Foreign visitors will need to key in their Disembarkation/Embarkation (DE) Number, or passport details to retrieve their e-Pass.

Where applicable, they should also check with the airline to ensure that they are allowed to board the plane as airlines have the prerogative to issue boarding passes to their passengers.As Singapore’s border measures and entry requirements will evolve as the global situation changes, please visit the MOH website and ICA website for the latest updates on travel and health control measures.It is important for a long-term pass holder to renew his/her foreign passport if it is expiring. Ensuring that a passport remains valid will allow ICA to determine his/her foreign citizenship.For all matters relating to foreign passport, please approach the respective Embassy/Consulate/Overseas Mission in Singapore.Once a new passport is obtained, a long-term pass holder will need to update his/her new passport details with the relevant issuing authority accordingly.ICA-issued Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders are required to update his/her new passport details with ICA accordingly once he/she has been issued with a new passport.\n",

                "answer": "Generally, as long as long-term passes (i.e. Student's Pass, Long Term Visit Pass, Work Permit, Employment Pass and Dependant’s Pass, etc.) are valid, the pass holders are able to use their current valid passport upon seeking arrival and departure immigration clearance at the Singapore checkpoints.However, they are advised to be mindful of the immigration requirements of any country they wish to depart, visit or place of return when travelling on a passport that is less than six months valid before embarking on their journey. Where applicable, they should also check with the airline to ensure that they are allowed to board the plane as airlines have the prerogative to issue boarding passes to their passengers.As Singapore’s border measures and entry requirements will evolve as the global situation changes, please visit the MOH website and ICA website for the latest updates on travel and health control measures.It is important for a long-term pass holder to renew his/her foreign passport if it is expiring. Ensuring that a passport remains valid will allow ICA to determine his/her foreign citizenship.For all matters relating to foreign passport, please approach the respective Embassy/Consulate/Overseas Mission in Singapore.Once a new passport is obtained, a long-term pass holder will need to update his/her new passport details with the relevant issuing authority accordingly.ICA-issued Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders are required to update his/her new passport details with ICA accordingly once he/she has been issued with a new passport.",

In this case, to ensure a seamless and smooth travel experience, the traveller should use a group QR code that contains his/her three other travelling companions' profiles if only four (and not five) people are travelling.Tip: Traveller can create a group QR code that has five profiles and another separate QR code that contains four profiles. Different QR codes can be named uniquely (e.g., Family, Friends, and Colleagues).\nQuestion 1: Can travellers update the members in the group QR code for different trips?\nAnswer 1: The MyICA mobile app can store multiple group QR codes with different group members. Travellers can edit the members in a group by adding or removing the member profile and regenerating the QR code even in offline mode (i.e., without mobile data). Travellers have the option to customise group names (e.g., 'Family', or 'Friends') to better fit their travel requirements.\nQuestion 2: What should the traveller do when his/her QR code is expiring?\nAnswer 2: When the traveller accesses the QR code via the MyICA mobile app and their passports is still valid, the QR code's validity will be automatically extended. Hence, no further actions are required for these group of travellers.The QR code will be invalid for use once the passport has expired. MyICA mobile app will prompt users that their passport has expired or is expiring (i.e., passport with less than six months' validity).After travellers have received a new passport, they can update their or others' profile information in MyICA mobile app. This includes making changes to details such as the new passport number and passport expiry date.\nQuestion 3: What will happen if a traveller or his/her travel companion submits wrong passport information while generating the QR code?\nAnswer 3: It is crucial for travellers to verify and confirm the accuracy of the details included in the QR code. Failure to do so may lead to inconvenience when they undergo immigration clearance at Singapore Land checkpoints.If you need to correct any inaccuracies in the information you have provided, you may edit the details through navigating to the 'edit' option under your profile.\nQuestion 4: Can I submit the SG Arrival Card for multiple trips under 'Group Submission'?\nAnswer 4: The 'Group Submission' is meant for a group of persons who are travelling to Singapore together for one trip.\n",

Where applicable, they should also check with the airline to ensure that they are allowed to board the plane as airlines have the prerogative to issue boarding passes to their passengers.As Singapore’s border measures and entry requirements will evolve as the global situation changes, please visit the MOH website and ICA website for the latest updates on travel and health control measures.It is important for a long-term pass holder to renew his/her foreign passport if it is expiring. Ensuring that a passport remains valid will allow ICA to determine his/her foreign citizenship.For all matters relating to foreign passport, please approach the respective Embassy/Consulate/Overseas Mission in Singapore.Once a new passport is obtained, a long-term pass holder will need to update his/her new passport details with the relevant issuing authority accordingly.ICA-issued Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders are required to update his/her new passport details with ICA accordingly once he/she has been issued with a new passport.\nQuestion 2: Should I update the photo in the current passport if my/my child's facial appearance has changed?\nAnswer 2: Regardless of age, you should apply for a new passport with an updated photo if your facial appearance has changed significantly. This will help to facilitate immigration clearance and avoid any misunderstandings over the identity of the passport holder at any checkpoint. The prevailing application fee for a new passport applies.\nQuestion 3: How long will the passport application process take?\nAnswer 3: The processing time for a passport is around 1 to 2 weeks. The processing time will be longer if your photograph does not meet the standard requirements.If you do not hear from us after 2 weeks from the date of application, you may contact us via the enquiry form for assistance.\nQuestion 4: What should I do if I need to travel urgently but I do not have a valid passport?\nAnswer 4: Singapore citizens who require your passport urgently may approach our service ambassadors at Level 1, ICA Services Centre during our operating hours.

You can visit the e-Pass portal or use the Visit Pass Validity Tool to check the expiry of your e-Pass or visit pass.

Holder of ordinary, diplomatic, public affairs and service PRC passports are excluded.\nQuestion 2: Do I have to retrieve or download and print the approved e-Visa to travel to Singapore?\nAnswer 2: You are strongly encouraged to print and bring along your e-Visa to avoid any inconvenience as the airlines and immigration authorities of your country of embarkation are likely to ask for the e-Visa for verification.You can retrieve your valid e-Visa via the 'Enquire Application Status' function at the ICA e-Service with the visa application reference number and applicant's travel document number.\nQuestion 3: Do the People’s Republic of China (PRC) nationals need to apply for an entry visa if they intend to stay for more than 30 days?\nAnswer 3: With effect from 9 February 2024, holders of ordinary passports issued by the People’s Republic of China will be exempted from visa requirements for a stay of up to 30 days in Singapore.

In this case, to ensure a seamless and smooth travel experience, the traveller should use a group QR code that contains his/her three other travelling companions' profiles if only four (and not five) people are travelling.Tip: Traveller can create a group QR code that has five profiles and another separate QR code that contains four profiles.

Hence, no further actions are required for these group of travellers.The QR code will be invalid for use once the passport has expired. MyICA mobile app will prompt users that their passport has expired or is expiring (i.e., passport with less than six months' validity).After travellers have received a new passport, they can update their or others' profile information in MyICA mobile app. This includes making changes to details such as the new passport number and passport expiry date.\nQuestion 3: If a traveller plans to visit Malaysia with three companions but has initially generated a group QR code for a total of five people, what should he/she do when only four people are going for the trip?\nAnswer 3: It is important that those travelling in a group use a group QR code containing the passport details of those travelling in the same vehicle. In this case, to ensure a seamless and smooth travel experience, the traveller should use a group QR code that contains his/her three other travelling companions' profiles if only four (and not five) people are travelling.Tip: Traveller can create a group QR code that has five profiles and another separate QR code that contains four profiles. Different QR codes can be named uniquely (e.g., Family, Friends, and Colleagues).\nQuestion 4: What will happen if a traveller or his/her travel companion submits wrong passport information while generating the QR code?\nAnswer 4: It is crucial for travellers to verify and confirm the accuracy of the details included in the QR code. Failure to do so may lead to inconvenience when they undergo immigration clearance at Singapore Land checkpoints.If you need to correct any inaccuracies in the information you have provided, you may edit the details through navigating to the 'edit' option under your profile.\n",

A valid entry visa is a pre-entry requirement that you must apply for before travelling to seek entry into Singapore if you hold a travel document issued by one of the following countries/places listed on ICA website.Possessing a valid visa does not guarantee entry into Singapore. You will have to satisfy the basic entry requirements (https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart/entering-singapore) before being considered for entry into Singapore.The grant of a visit pass is determined by the ICA officers at the point of entry. The period of stay granted is shown on the visit pass endorsement given on the passport or the electronic Visit Pass (e-Pass) issued to you through email. You can visit the e-Pass portal or use the Visit Pass Validity Tool to check the expiry of your e-Pass or visit pass. Please note that the period of stay is not tied to the validity of your entry visa.You may refer to ICA website for more information should you require to extend your visit pass.\nQuestion 2: Can I submit the SG Arrival Card for multiple trips under 'Group Submission'?\nAnswer 2: The 'Group Submission' is meant for a group of persons who are travelling to Singapore together for one trip.\nQuestion 3: What is the processing time for visa application?\nAnswer 3: The processing time is within three (3) working days, excluding the day of submission. Some applications may take longer to process, especially during peak periods.You can use the Enquire Application Status function to check on the progress of your application.\nQuestion 4: How many visa applications can the local contact/ sponsor apply?\nAnswer 4: There is no restriction to the number of visa applications that a local contact/ sponsor can apply. However, every visa application is assessed and considered on its own merits.\n",

A valid entry visa is a pre-entry requirement that you must apply for before travelling to seek entry into Singapore if you hold a travel document issued by one of the following countries/places listed on ICA website.Possessing a valid visa does not guarantee entry into Singapore. You will have to satisfy the basic entry requirements (https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart/entering-singapore) before being considered for entry into Singapore.The grant of a visit pass is determined by the ICA officers at the point of entry. The period of stay granted is shown on the visit pass endorsement given on the passport or the electronic Visit Pass (e-Pass) issued to you through email. You can visit the e-Pass portal or use the Visit Pass Validity Tool to check the expiry of your e-Pass or visit pass. Please note that the period of stay is not tied to the validity of your entry visa.You may refer to ICA website for more information should you require to extend your visit pass.",
