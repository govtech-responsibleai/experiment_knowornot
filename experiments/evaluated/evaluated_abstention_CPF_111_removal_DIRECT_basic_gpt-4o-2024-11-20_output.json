Hence, the computation of CPF will be based on net earnings after taking into consideration such expenses. The net earnings will be based on gross earnings minus the Fixed Expense Deduction Amount (FEDA). The use of FEDA reflects expenses for the vast majority of platform workers.The FEDA takes reference from the Fixed Expense Deduction Ratio developed by IRAS for the computation of net earnings for tax purposes. This is based on actual expense ratios, including industry feedback and surveys on the expenses of workers. Some of the common allowable business expenses incurred by delivery workers and PHC/ taxi drivers include:Rental costsFuel/charging costsRepairs and maintenance costsParkingService fees paid to operatorsMobile phone subscription planRoad taxThe use of FEDA provides significant convenience for both you and your platform operators. You will not have to keep receipts to track and compute actual expenses for your platform work and submit them to your platform operators. Your platform operators will not have to incur additional operating costs to re-compute the CPF contribution based on actual expenses.",

Staying committed to the CPF contributions will also ensure that your CPF savings will accumulate interest over time, thereby building up your housing and retirement adequacy in the long run.Allowing opt-outs will not help build up your housing and retirement adequacy in the long run. It is also not practical for platform operators to track the status of workers and apply the different rates of CPF contributions if workers opt in and out multiple times. This may incur additional business costs for platform operators and make implementation more complicated overall.As there is no deadline to opt in, you can carefully consider your decision based on your personal circumstances, before opting in to increase your CPF contributions.",
